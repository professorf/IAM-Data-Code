1,Post 1,B,"Good morning all! I really enjoyed the videos as a different approach to learning this week. I was struck most by how ""typically American"" the instructor in the Iron and Silk clips seemed in going into a Chinese classroom with so little preparation for the culture in which he was engaging. Do you think our culture is more prone to this type of behavior or is it a human condition? Either way, how do we as educators avoid the faux pas this teacher made? How have you personally been more culturally sensitive in interactions with people from different walks of life?",1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Especially since he was going to a foreign country to teach, it wasn't as if he was teaching in America and didn't realize that he had some Chinese students. It was good that he did ultimately learn more about their culture while he was there and he was fortunate that he didn't seem to do anything truly offensive to the students while he was there. To avoid many of the faux pas that he made he could have learned more about Chinese customs before teaching. The woman that was helping him learn more about their customs seemed to be a valuable resource that he should have worked with sooner. At the same time, we know that not all people from a certain culture are the same and we can't place stereotypes on groups so how do we walk that line of considering culture and not stereotyping groups as we teach?",3,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I would think the teacher would study up on the cultures of the place he was going to be teaching to become more familiar with it and to help make connections. Adults learn by drawing from previous experiences and from making connections, so if a person is unable to do this it makes it difficult to learn. Here in the Southwest we use terms here that people in other parts of the United States are not familiar with, which makes it difficult to understand the context as well as make connections, which in turn affects ones ability to learn. When I am teaching and I have foreign exchange students I like to include them in on the discussions and learn about their cultures. I had a student from Italy, who was completed shocked at the level of disrespect she was witnessing from her American classmates in her classes and shared with her classmates that  in her country behavior like that isn't tolerated at all. When she started sharing this it got the other students in the classroom discussing, asking questions, and learning about each other.

4,Post1_R2,E,"Hi Michelle and Stephanie,

The videos are striking examples to think about how culture and language influence communication, teaching, and learning, and how differently cultures prepare their adherents to value respect, humility, openness, humor, hospitality etc. The teacher reminded me more of a picaresque figure who has been inserted in the narrative to teach us about Chinese culture rather than the exaggerated  blundering of a figure of the typical American that other cultures have come to expect and ridicule. I wonder whether this could be used as a teaching device in and of itself but with a figure who is unlinked from any given culture, just one that represents behaviors, actions, thoughts we are trying to find real world alternatives for. Our sensibility is jogged when we see these examples which leads us to want to rectify or do better.

Thinking about languages that are high and low context makes me think of the examples that have been presented regarding the benefits of supporting translanguaging to create richer and more layered exchanges. And always openness for what other cultures may bring to the mix; one of my jobs as a student when I moved to Cologne was interpreting for Ghanese asylum seekers, usually these were first interviews and unless people had the good fortune and money of getting Amnesty International aid or such, they were not given much room to present their cases. I remember one case in which a man was desperate to live in Germany with his family because he was being persecuted. Part of this persecution involved Voodoo. As I interpreted for this man, I tried to create a context in order to validate this man and his family's belief system. I was accosted by the judge to stop how I was translating and stick to a verbatim account of what was being said. This incident together with the many other sad cases I dealt with over the two years I did this job led me to quit.  Many years later when I was teaching English in a European secretary prep school, among my students was a young woman who was Turkish. Her brother brought her to school every day, she would disappear in the bathroom and come out dressed in Western clothing, and before school let out, she would go and reverse the process. I found myself changing my teaching style significantly for fear of being disrespectful of this young woman's frame of propriety, and when it came time to engage in some extracurricular activities such as going to an English movie, Pulp Fiction clearly was not going to be appropriate for her, but I already knew this would not be possible because it was a night time activity anyway. To what extent was I actually acting out a microinvalidation? Would communicating about her preferences and her frame of reference been appropriate instead of making assumptions? Having been discriminated against most of my teenage years in Germany because my appearance led people to believe I was Turkish, I thought I was showing respect by not talking down to this young woman, but perhaps I was making decisions for her she wanted to make for herself since she had agency while she was at school.

It seems in the eLearning environment, it may actually be easier to circumnavigate some of these sorts of cultural straits because of the flexibility of using a variety of activities and access points for learning. Discussion guidelines can be adjusted to show deference for different cultures. Similar to the way new items are now prefaced as having content that may disturb x,y,z perhaps this can be included in information about content to be discussed.

Culture can also refer to the hierarchical culture within organizations. I used to teach English to the staff of an engineering company and it was fascinating how leadership and regular staff members interacted, because I had them dialog and do activities. In particular going from German with it's formal and informal ""you"" to the much more relaxed English you, led to visible discomfort in some situations. Interestingly, nowadays in Germany it seems as if there is a clear move toward supporting informal communication over more formal communication and in job advertising a special point is made about describing your company as having ""flat hierarchical structures"" and a ""Duz-Kultur"" or ""informal you culture"" being promoted.

Sorry this is so long, but this is a topic I have had so much experience with - also when traveling in Europe - how one is perceived, how things shift depending on whether one is considered part of the culture or not - what a good or bad accent in certain countries can lead to - gender, marital status (I highly recommend visiting Rome alone as a woman only if you are visibly pregnant; you'll be treated like a madonna), etc. etc. ",10,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
5,Post1_R3,H,"Hi Michelle-
I agree that the teacher was not prepared sufficiently for the task ahead, but I'm not sure it was entirely his fault. For example; he was obviously teaching at a school of some kind, perhaps the administration should have provided him with a ""cultural handbook"" that he can read in advance since they knew he was coming from out of town. To answer your first question, I think everyone gets used to the culture they live in and don't really learn how other cultures operate until they either visit or move to that country. Sometimes when I'm interacting with someone from a different culture, I ask what kind of food they like and then try it with them. Food is the great unifier, and can be very helpful in bringing cultures together. What is your favorite food from a different culture?

This may be particularly true of instructors and I think that I myself have been guilty of this.  It can be nerve racking to be ""up there in the spotlight"", but there are important clues that are given by those introductions that can really help an instructor do a better job.

One of my best friends is the exact opposite: she is unabashedly American and just shows up. As a result we each had very different experiences while in Germany, both fulfilling and memorable. I saw the cities we visited from an every-day German perspective, and she interacted with people who sought her out for conversation because she was American. I think as long as that attitude doesn't mean you're causing gross cultural offense, it can certainly provide a rewarding interaction between a teacher and student of different cultures.",0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
8,Post1_R3_1_1_1,I,"Hello - Michelle M., Wyatt, Pete, and Eva.  I can see both sides.  I do think the teacher was ill-prepared, but he still tried to be respectful.  I have tried to do Michelle M.'s approach as well when I travel.  However, there is only so much that books can teach you, and YouTube travel vlogs only show the view point of the creator.  As such, I have gotten things wrong before.  Like Teacher Mark in the film, it was not the end of the world, but it did show my ignorance.  For example, my husband is in law enforcement, and when he has to arrest a person who can only speak Spanish, he tries to use the formal version of ""you"" so that the people he has in custody does not think he is being disrepectful/demeaning towards them.  I tried this with my broken Spanish when we went to CDMX in January.  I then wondered why I got crazy looks from people younger than me when I addressed them in this manner.  I was trying to be respectful to everyone I would meet, but when I returned, a friend from CDMX told me never to use the formal ""you"" to people unquestionably younger than me; it just simply was not done.  So, I can see what Eva has gone through regarding context and when to use the formal vs. informal.

I guess it is kind of like that animated film where the teacher from Massachusetts misinterpreted the methods Navajo children used to learn as disobedience.  Small faux pas such as this aside, I still do not think it hurts to prepare, especially if an institution is bringing you in to teach.  I agree with Wyatt and Pete.

I think it is hard for the instructor in Iron and Silk to plan for a culture shock he hasn't had yet. I think everyone can go through a trans-cultural event when they arrive somewhere new, and he was very lucky to have the other teacher mentor him to adjust to his new location.

13,Post 2,A,"Something we've been discussing from the very beginning is how language is one of the many parts that make up our culture. I've learned that language is a very powerful tool that is used not only for communication but to establish how we view others. Through language, we identify people by their social class and make assumptions before we even establish any sort of rapport with the individual. I thought about this while watching the clips from our module and how they made assumptions about people. For example, in Iron and Silk, Mark assumed that he assigned a relevant assignment to his class where they expressed one of their happiest moments. He realizes after some of the students share that they have never experienced a happy moment because many of them are poor and do not have the luxury to indulge in things that Mark may identify as ""happy."" In Culture Shock, the teacher assumed that his students were cheating off each other when they were trying to help each other out because group learning is a part of their culture, and it was not until he experienced it firsthand that he realized what he did was not appropriate. The Race and Social Justice videos, on the other hand, provided a great example of how we classify people based on their accent and shrug them off because their language skills are not superior. Sadly, I see this happen in many schools where teachers and students do not make attempts to interact with their peers because of some sort of language barrier. One way to correct this is by welcoming the use of different languages in our learning environment and modeling appropriate ways to respond just like the Race and Social Justice videos showed us. My students felt more comfortable speaking Spanish when they would hear me speak, and we learned different signs from the interpreter so our ASL students would see and feel comfortable signing. It's these changes that make the learning environment inclusive.

The way we view language is going to dictate the language choices we use in our content and how we address our expert blind spots. I always try my best to use simplified language in the content I create because it needs to be comprehensible for everyone. Even when I was working as an elementary teacher, there were times where it was hard for me to simplify a concept for students, and I was fortunate to have an ASL interpreter to show us some ASL to provide another alternative to understanding vocabulary. Now I rely on my peers to help me identify terms that may need to be simplified for some of our users because the content we create is not only for faculty, it is for all university employees. Furthermore, I love to use visuals. I try to present content with relevant pictures that are easy to understand and pair them with specific words or phrases. This is another way to make language accessible to everyone.


Overall, the point that I am trying to make is that language dictates how we teach and learn. As instructors, we need to make sure the language that we use is accessible to everyone so learning can take place.",3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

Love the points you are making. How appropriate I found it to come across this article on npr today about the myriad changes being made to dictionary.com to keep up with social change, a changing view of psychological illnesses, social and racial injustice etc.: https://www.npr.org/2020/09/03/909494937/dictionary-coms-largest-update-re-defines-thousands-of-words-focusing-on-identity

So, we must also look at language as a flexible, ever-changing entity meaning anything we put online requires constant reassessment and what works one year may not be valid the next.  In this flow it makes it even more evident that everything is just an approximation and so I wonder whether the beauty of the WisCom is that it can develop artifacts knowing these are fluid and just serve as a further tool for incremental learning?",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
15,Post 2_R1_1,B,"Ava, your real-life experiences and how they made you feel and act are so powerful! How incredibly frustrating it must have been to try to bring meaning to your translations and be forced to ignore such a crucial part of what you were hearing from the Ghanese asylum seeker! 

I agree that the American in the Iron and Silk videos was not necessarily a fleshed-out character and we didn't see the whole film, just scenes to promote a dialog. I also know that many Americans who travel and live abroad are culturally sensitive or at least are in another country to learn and explore. I do feel, however, that many Americans suffer from a bit of an isolationist mindset which is further reinforced by the belief that we live in the greatest country ever. There is unfortunately a reason for the phrase 'ugly American,"" used regarding travelers who don't seem to have any cultural sensitivity.

But to return to how we can make the online education community more effective through language and cultural sensitivity, I really appreciate you sharing your experiences living in Europe. I'm particularly struck by the notion of German moving to a more informal usage of ""you"" and think this shows a real-time evolution of language toward a more connected dynamic. I was an English undergrad and I love studying the way our language has evolved, but even more importantly, I think communication is the ultimate goal and if a more informal style of speaking conveys a meaning to more people, I think the benefit outweighs the notion of a ""proper language.""

This idea ties in with Melissa's points about language choices. Melissa, I love the phrase ""expert blind spots."" And I really applaud that you make your Spanish speaking and ASL students comfortable with your flexibility!

I have always been a firm believer that the best way to communicate with learners is by genuinely making attempts to communicate. In eLearning, this can be done through emails or by acknowledging their presence in discussions. Utilizing visuals in your content will show learners that you are making genuine attempts to make content understandable. I also recommend providing opportunities for learners to share personal experiences, this can be done both between you and the learner, or in whole-group.

Regarding your question:   Do you have any advice for monolinguistic teachers?
I agree with Melissa's statement that you need to make a genuine effort at communication and show interest in the other person.  The only language that I speak well is English.  I often use an interpreter to communicate with my patients.  But I find it is important to watch the patient as she is talking, not the interpreter.  I'm not really having an interaction with the interpreter.  The interpreter is just a tool (not meant to be offensive) in this scenario.  I make eye contact with the patient.  I watch her facial expression and listen to the tone, volume, speed of her speech.

I always go back to my grandmother's story. Coming to Albuquerque to go to school, only knowing Spanish because she was a first generation American, and poorly she was treated for not knowing English. She struggled to learn in school because there were no supports back them for English Language Learners (ELLs). After she learned a little bit of English, she remembers overhearing two teachers talking about her saying that she wasn't smart because she was still not learning at the pace her English language peers were. She was devastated! This story has always broken my heart, that she was made to feel that way just because she didn't speak the same language as most other people at her school. Thankfully, my grandma decided later to use that as motivation to prove them wrong. She became a very successful, bilingual woman in her adult life even becoming the COO of a major corporation. 

A sad consequence of this however was that she didn't work to teach her own children Spanish, focusing only on English, so that they would never have to struggle the way that she did. So my dad and his siblings were denied part of their cultural background in the language that the family had spoken for generations. My grandma regrets that decision today and has started speaking Spanish with her kids and grandchildren as we have all been working to learn it on out own because we are proud of where she came from.

27,Post 3,O,"This post made me think of a social justice of education course I took, in the course, we read Sonia Nieto�s Affirming Diversity, The Sociopolitical Context of Multicultural Education, to apply social justice theories to the experiences expressed by the children of her research. She utilized subjects representing a variety of demographics and schools in society to highlight the change in population and the ever-growing need for multicultural education to support children�s success in all school settings. In her case studies, she used the children�s voices and experiences to gain further insight into social class, ethnic and racial issues, as well as the need for understanding the context of language and culture within the educational setting. Using a diverse group of students, we looked at several social theories to explore some of the themes, issues, and concerns within the educational setting that were impacting overall school success among these groups. Her research provides the unique opportunity to gain insight from the students who are navigating within these complex social structures. It was clear from their experiences that there is much work needed to address the inequality and the continued failing education system. Students in her research who entered the classroom in the U.S. come with a diversity of experiences including race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, and overall development patterns. It was evident in reading her research that the focus for the teacher should be to teach all students and to understand what that means it not only takes an understanding of the student we are trying to teach but an understanding of ourselves as educators. When teachers truly care about the students they are working with and take the time to understand who they are, where they come from, what their needs are, and allows this to be a part of the classroom dynamic, it begins to break down some of the barriers we have seen in the education process. This approach can make the experience more meaningful and impactful for the student and educator alike. There are many ways we can incorporate what we have learned into more effective multicultural education models, however Nieto raises caution with having incomplete conceptualizations and operationalizations of such a complex educational reform movement. She argues that the most common understanding of multicultural education is additive content rather than structural changes in content and process (Nieto, 1994). If it is to be effective, I feel multicultural education is not something we �do�, it must be �lived� and an intentional and changing approach based on the dynamics of the individuals within that learning environment.

The ""additive"" approach to educational content is especially valuable, I believe, because it is one that could most easily be incorporated into existing learning formats: simply adding culturally-aware content may feel easier to achieve for teachers than completely re-working a course design. I do think, however, that content which excludes another's experience should be removed. I'm thinking of the discussion surrounding standardized tests several years ago where examples of questions show they were clearly written from a certain socio-economic-language-education frame of reference.
Your call for multi-cultural education to be a lifestyle rather a job is key.

Our parents or guardians or community members take the responsibility to teach their ways to ensure that we are accepted into our distinct groups. At this stage, we learn normative rules for engagement with members within our communities. In Latin America and North America, using the wrong pronoun, in Spanish, to address your elders says a lot about your upbringing. Using t� with an elder versus usted is a form of disrespect or disregard for elders. We learn the rules for communication soon after acquiring our ability to verbalize or use nonverbal cues. There are ""good words"" and there are ""bad words."" Those words differ by group. Communication is also varying and is influenced by our audience. We adapt our vocabulary and communication style to suit the relationship we have with our intended audience.
In the United States, there is a dominant group, this group shares a ""standardized"" language and use similar communication patterns. The members of the dominant group are mostly of the same ethnic make-up. The dominant group establishes its cultural norms.
In the Goodfellow and Hewing reading, they discuss elements of the dominant culture that linger in all aspects of society including education known as ""standard"" functionality. In this article, they also categorize learners into two groups individualistic and collectivist. In the video animation, we saw an example of a teacher who had an individualistic view. He made several assumptions taken from his dominant view of the education system and imposed those views on a population of students who did not understand his view.
To create content that is culturally inclusive one needs to have the knowledge and an understanding of how people communicate, communications patterns, and rules for engagement. For a learning module to be culturally inclusive one needs to implement and utilize tools that give equal access to every learner. This would look like allowing discussions to flow naturally, give participants options on how to participate in sessions: chat: synchronous, asynchronous, recorded video, or private messaging with the teacher/facilitator/professor.

I appreciate you applying individualism and collectivism in what we saw in the videos.

As I reflect on this idea of individualism, I am thinking about how our education system values individualism over collectivism. I know that in recent times we are trying to steer into a collectivist mindset when it comes to learning new content but the expectation is to still do something on our own which means that we are still so heavily rooted in individualism. 
I think you made an excellent point that in order to be an effective instructor you have to understand how people communicate. This is something I am beginning to learn as I adjust to my work as an instructional designer and seeing how my coworkers who have studied communication are really good at their work and have a better understanding of their audience. Not to go get off track, but this is something I plan to pursue after I'm done with my Master's degree.

This is similar to the Native Americans as well who open their homes to extended family and friends to share food on their respective feast days or our New Mexican ""Spanish"" population who celebrate ""la fiestas"" in their respective communities i.e. Las Matanzas.
In the U.S., this individualistic ideal remains dominant in many aspects of culture including education, as you shared, but same the same can be said about how we ""share"" food.

54,Post 7,G,"I has been very interesting reading the comments in this thread.

The thought that kept occurring to me during this block was, ""As an instructional designer, what assumptions am I making about the student or the instructor?"".
Those assumptions might involve their cultural or lingual base, how the student learns or how the instructor teaches. 

It is very easy to make incorrect assumptions in these areas, and I have been guilty of it myself.  Where I work, the subject matter advisor and/or designer for a course are often not the people who will actually teach.  They are never the students.  So, if they assume that the student or the instructor has a base of knowledge (cultural or lingual) that does not exist and is not specifically listed as a prerequisite, we have a major problem.  That is one of the reasons that we peer review lesson plans in a manner to ensure that the reviewer has little or no knowledge base about the subject.  But, these assumptions can still creep into the design.

For example, one of the areas of instruction that we design for involves becoming licensed to drive a commercial motor vehicle (A semi-truck/18 wheeler).  There is probably an assumption in there that the student comes from a culture that has a significant background with operating machinery.  Specifically, that they have experience operating a manual transmission.  While many people my age learned to drive on a manual transmission, this is becoming less and less common.  So, does that bias set some students up for failure because it isn't taking into account their cultural experience (generational)?  I think it probably does.

Another example more related to language, and the bane of my existence, is acronyms.  The first training I ever attended at my current job was basically a safety course.  The instructor referenced so many acronyms in the first 15 minutes that I felt completely lost and seriously wondered if I had missed a prerequisite.  I leaned over to the student next to me and asked if he understood what the instructor was saying.  To both my relief and dismay, he was as confused as I was. There was an assumption that the students shared a language culture and understood what all of the acronyms he used meant.  The training was essentially useless - a complete waste of time and resources.

I do not feel it is only the student who can be adversely effected by this problem.  Both the Iron and Silk videos and the video about the teacher in northern New Mexico left me wondering, ""Who designed this course?  What preparation did they build in for the instructor?""  It seemed to me that both of those instructors had really been set up for failure.  I suppose it is possible that they designed their own courses, in which case they have no one to blame but themselves.  But, if they were hired to teach a course of instruction that had already been created, it should have included a lot more information about the target audience, their background, culture, language skills, etc.  They both probably needed much more exposure to the culture in which they were operating in order to be effective.  It should have been a prerequisite. 

I really appreciate this discussion.  While I think I have tried to take these things into account in a subconscious way before, I now believe that I can do that much more actively and consciously.  That can only be positive.  Thank you all.",6,0,4,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2

I do not even work with the military, which is infamous for having too many acronyms, and my job has so many, not to mention the names of so many specialty systems.  I have also been guilty of training using jargon at work and later realizing that I lost people.  I do not think this so much cultural exclusion in the traditional sense of the term (i.e., language, national origin, etc.), but it definitely sets apart those familiar with the systems from those learning, which can be intimidating.  I like your example of those who know how to drive a standard transmission vehicle versus those who do not.  I can also see how this can transfer this unintentional from the non-traditional sense to the traditional sense.  In the case of your example, I think it touches on the realm of age.  I know I am overgeneralizing, but every Millennial who has ridden in my car has been impressed that I have a standard transmission.  In fact, it was really difficult to find the configuration I wanted with a standard transmission when I purchased the car nine years ago.  I have a feeling it will be all but impossible now.
Do you think a lot of this may not be knowing your audience - not as in you not trying, but as in not having the adequate information?  For example, when I was asked to teach the financial systems ""course,"" (I am not a trainer, but was asked to give some folks a crash ad hoc training session so they could take on a new responsibility), I was given no background on them regarding finance training or experience.  Also, as an instructional designer, how to you deal with inclusion as far as students with different experience levels?  In the videos, Teacher Mark and the guy from Massachusetts seemed to have learners at roughly the same level as that is how formal academic education is structured.  However, when it comes to the type of workplace development that you do (and that I was asked to do), you get learners at all different levels.  I am unsure as to how to ensure the more experienced folks are not bored while not losing the beginners, especially when there is a strict time limit.

58,Post 7_2_1,G,"Michelle, Inclusion for different levels of knowledge is very tricky for me.
The easy way for me to deal with it as a designer is a prerequisite course or test.  The student has to have demonstrated applied knowledge before they can attend.  But, that usually only works for advanced courses.  It can be helpful, but it is no guarantee.
In a basic course, it can be very tricky and a lot of it can be dependent on the instructor.  To help the instructor out, I try to design the curriculum in a way that forces them to go over the basic foundation that the course is trying to lay down.
One problem that we often encounter in my job is people who actually have prior knowledge and experience, but it is outdated or ""bad"" experience.  For example, knowing how to drive doesn't mean one knows how to drive safely.
You also run the risk of boring the more advanced students with basics.  I really liked how the book described using more advanced students to build a community of learning.  I have done that to an extent and it can be very effective.  It also sets up a mentor relationship and helps the truly new student move through that zone of proximal development where they might feel overwhelmed.

I think it is one of the hardest aspects of instructional design, to understand your learner adequately. You're right, it is so easy to assume that the learner has the prerequisite knowledge needed, but doing so can mean setting the learner up for failure if we are wrong. This is where cultural stereotypes can really play in as well. I remember in one of the videos about micro-aggressions a man saying that his teacher picked him out of a group to help fix a bicycle possibly because he was a Hispanic male and there are assumptions that they are good at that type of work. Wow! He can't possibly know how to do every labor type of job, even if the stereotype were true, but can you imagine if instructors approached him that way in learning those types of things? He would often be taught with the disadvantage of not receiving the base of knowledge he needs. ",1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
60,Post 7_3_1,G,"Stephaine, Exactly.  I attended college in upstate New York.  When I was a sophomore,, I got into a discussion with a professor in a political science class.  At one point, he said to me, ""Well, your attitude is understandable:  You are from the South.""  I was literally dumbstruck for a second before I told him, ""I come from Indiana, sir.""  His response was, ""Yes! Exactly!""
After I got over how badly he understood the geography of his own country and the history of the civil war, I began to think about what else he assumed about me because I where he THOUGHT I was from.  I found out that he was not alone in thinking I was probably a ""rube from the sticks"".  Other professors had based their assessment of my capabilities on that. It is dangerous.  But, it is also so easy to do.  I've done it.  
My brother in law grew up on a farm in Indiana (I did not).  I asked him if he could drive my truck one day and had actually made plans assuming that he could.  He then told me, ""I cannot operate a manual transmission.""  I was shocked.  Back then, I thought, ""How did you grow up on a farm and never learn to drive a manual transmission?""  That was an assumption I had made about his knowledge base.
I'm really glad we are having this discussion, because I think it will really help me as I evaluate curriculum.  It will lead me to bring that question of what I am assuming to the forefront of my mind.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

I have been in many courses where I did not feel prepared to take them and my peers felt similarly.

We all have biases towards people and things, and as you mentioned the only way to be mindful of our bias is to acknowledge that we have them. I have little experience as an instructional designer, I developed one training module in the past year, and it was a rewarding experience which gave me the opportunity to reflect on my bias. One helpful question I asked my self, and which you mention in your post, is ""what assumptions am I making about the learner.""

63,Post 8,N,"I found the Race and Social Justice Index Cards the most interesting part of this week's texts. I did enjoy the different learning format of having videos assigned as texts instead of just readings, as some others have mentioned. The culture shock clip reminded me of the idea of whole community learning that Dr. Lani was talking about in our last zoom session. I also see how the teacher in the Iron and Silk videos seems unprepared for his teaching assignment because of his ignorance of the high context Chinese culture. However, I doubt he recognizes his lack of preparedness because he seems to think his exposure to Chinese language and martial arts through films sufficient.
Going back to the index cards, I related to the concepts addressed because I have taught them before. I teach explicitly with my students whenever I can - deliberately outlining and explaining my thought processes and/or behaviors as I model them in the classroom. Particularly, I try to emphasize teaching about historical contexts of marginalization, institutionalized racism, and the inherent privilege afforded white students learning in the historical context of the colonized United States.  One example, I specifically teach the importance of naming and using names at the beginning of each school year. Another example, my South Valley school deliberately recognizes the impact of cultural norms on our students' attendance since many, many of them will miss several days of school surrounding a holiday break in order to get in an extended visit to Mexico to see family. A third example, I teach the historical creation and progression of the American prison system from a method of re-enslavement to the school-to-prison pipeline, and the disenfranchisement of modern prisoners mired in the institutionalized racism inherent to the system.
One new way that I want to address cultural inclusivity in my learning designs to support diversity is to take the suggestion to spend time listening to different accents and varieties of English. I think this is important to me since I know about code-switching and SES based vernaculars but I am experiencing more with translanguaging from my ELL students in the South Valley.

Since we are talking about communication, how does low and high context culture affect learning? I was thinking about valuable it is to have background information to understand something which is a part of a high context culture, but what about low context? How does not having little to no context affect the way we construct knowledge? ",0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
71,Post 10,M,"Culture and language go hand in hand. I do not think you can have one without the other. For example, in part one of Iron and Silk there was a difference in culture and the way communication showed respect. The American teacher wanted to be called by his first name, but the students saw this as a sign of disrespect. They were not going to call him by his first name, but they did reach an agreement that satisfied both cultural preferences, the teacher being called Mark and the students having a title to identify him.
I though part 2 was informative. It showed me how much Chinese culture depends on being polite rather than the context of the spoken word. This is very confusing and frustrating in our culture, or at least it can be because communication should be clear and concise, just like effective online communication should be (75).
I grew up in the Midwest, Michigan, where most of my family and friends speak fast. Because of my geographical location, I was told my English had a Canadian dialect. This was no problem for me growing up, but when I moved out of state it was funny at first. Most people were amazed and would joke that I could be an auctioneer. After while it did become a nuisance. I would repeat nearly everything I said three times. After the second time I would exaggerate the slowness and annunciate the sounds. Sometimes the receiver would think I was frustrated, and the conversation lost its original meaning. I make it a priority to think about what I say and speak clearly but my husband still has to ask me several times to repeat what I say, even after 8 years of marriage.",3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

73,Post 11,J,"Culture influences teaching because we have very multicultural classrooms and the teacher could have different cultural norms and expectations from the students. The education system can be biased towards middle-class and white values of how to communicate, what is important to learn, and how to act while learning and working. The community students come from might have specific styles of teaching and learning that the students will feel most comfortable working in and can accelerate learning if utilized. If a teacher doesn't understand the local culture they can misinterpret their student's intentions or invalidate the student's work by being overly critical of it.  Teachers have to be careful to monitor themselves and their classrooms for microaggressions because casual speech can accidentally turn into a situation for students that is uncomfortable or offensive and distracts from the learning process.

74,Post 12,I,"The ""language"" of an area of study, whether it be in the professional or academic realms, has a big influence on the learning curve.  Before the last discussion forum, I felt as if I had a pretty fair grasp on the concept of cultural inclusivity as I am a person who has dealt with persons from all walks of life in both my work and personal areas of my life.  I have also studied cultures and the concept of cultural inclusivity through history and literature, and from and HR point-of-view academically in the various courses in my undergrad.  However, I had only read the book chapters prior to jumping into the last discussion board, and oh boy...I was quite lost.  As most folks in this course seem to be professional educators in one sense or another (i.e., teachers, corporate trainers, instructional designers, etc.), I was at a loss with some of the ""language"" being used.  I told my husband that I had not been this lost in a really long time.  However, aside from being stunned at my own ignorance (I suppose this can be classified as a form of cognitive dissonance), I nevertheless attempted to jump in and showed my hand...
There are a few things I learned from this.  First, culture does not have to be a large entity that defines large regions or groups of people.  It can be the idioculture (I had to keep looking up that word last week) of educators.  Second, I am learning a lot from you.  Initially, I was daunted by having to post regarding a concept I could barely articulate (hated it is more like it if I am being totally honest).  However, your responses were so helpful that I was actually be able to learn more than I would have on my own, which means that even though you are learners, you are also teachers.  Finally, ""listening"" to your stories and responses forced me to review outside sources on my own in order for me to understand some of the conversation.  It seems that by me trying to become part of your idioculture, my learning curve is being flattened because of the peer-to-peer support.  I have always kind of had to learn on my own, so this is a new experience and definitely expands my view of cultural inclusivity.
On a side note, I think the variety of knowledge delivery methods helps.  The book was informative, but the videos and flashcards really gave some frames of reference to the concepts.  I have been well-meaning yet off-the-mark when trying to deal with different groups before like the teacher from the culture shock video.  Also, I am still very fascinated by the translanguaging concept introduced in the last discussion, as well as in the videos this week.  This makes me wonder if total immersion is the best way to learn a new language as has been touted.  I have partially been putting off becoming fluent in Spanish until I move to a Spanish-speaking country because I have been told I will never truly learn until I am in a situation where I literally cannot use English, but it seems that less mistakes would be made using translanguaging as presented.",2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2
