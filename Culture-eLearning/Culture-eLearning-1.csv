1,Post 1,A ,"From what I have learned, I define culture as the beliefs and norms of a specific group which are passed down to later generations. This is a definition that I learned from multicultural education where we focused on the idea that our culture is a key factor in how we construct knowledge. As far as eLearning, I define it as a type of learning that is done online and very different from traditional classrooms because there is typically no face-to-face interaction and learning is done remotely without having to be in a physical classroom.

I like to think of eLearning as a way to bring different cultures together and this is how they are related. This means that people from different parts of the state, or the world for that matter, are learning with and about each other. This is one of the wonderful aspects of eLearning because it gives minority groups an opportunity to share their experiences with a wider audience than a traditional classroom would. For example, many students are uncomfortable sharing in face-to-face classroom discussions. In an online environment, you have to share your ideas and this is where many quiet students flourish because they are able to express themselves better than in a traditional classroom.

This told me that we were focused only on the actual presence of the adults caring for children and not the relationship and learning that takes place in the classroom each day. Within a couple of weeks we had groups of preschoolers using zoom and marco polo to have cirlce time, group activities, child led show and tell, and other learning and opportunities to maintain relationships.

I feel that both eLearning and in person instruction have their benefits among the community; however with digital instruction it can feel that you are just talking or producing content for a computer screen instead of having a sense of a ""classroom family"".  Another drawback to eLearning involves grading, whereas a traditional teacher might give assistance with extra points or special content for a student that is struggling, in many eLearning systems the material is uniform with limited customization for each student. I feel that eLearning is good on a hybrid or alternative schedule (as many schools are doing this fall) and has the benefit of being able to learn at unlimited places and/or times; however I don't think it will fully replace in person learning due to the rigidness of many eLearning system processes and procedures.",1,1,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The human element is what has made traditional face-to-face learning stand the test of time. People like physical assistance and face-to-face communication and seeing someone else's body language. Virtual learning can't replace that and that is why it such a huge issue for elementary teachers. Kids need compassion and support from a human being than from a person they see on a computer screen. In today's classrooms, it is so sad to see that many kids do not have a supportive adult in their lives and teachers are the first to provide that to some children.

27,Post 2,C,"Culture is a sum total of one's identity within an ethnic group. Culture includes food, art, traditions, celebrations, rituals, religion, beliefs, language (verbal and non-verbal). and dress. Culture is learned and transferred from one generation to another via oral traditions, interactions, and intentional teaching.  
eLearning is characterized as learning that is not in an in-person/classroom setting, using technology. This may require hardware and the use and knowledge of technology. eLearning is convenient for some and is accessible to learners in various geographic locations. eLearning is characterized as having pre-recorded learning modules that are interactive and immersive.

28,Post 2_1,A ,"Hi Mark, I think you made an excellent point that eLearning is somewhat of a novelty in many companies when it comes to training and development and usually used to meet the compliance rules of the organization. I believe that with our current situation, eLearning is at it's prime as it's not only a resource used by higher education and organizations, but they are being used at a pre-school and elementary education level. For example, our primary educators are using LMS systems to teach and I know that many want little to do with eLearning because they are used to traditional learning. I think people are afraid of eLearning because it's a learning curve, but there are so many benefits to eLearning that are overlooked and as we start collaborating this semester, we will see how accessible it is to many different groups. 
In regards to your definition of culture and eLearning, I agree with both of your definitions because they accurately define both terms. As far as eLearning and culture having the same set of rules, can you elaborate a bit more?

I have a biased view of eLearning as a former classroom teacher and now a facilitator for virtual learning. I acknowledge that eLearning is an effective means of learning with the potential of reaching a global audience and I realize that there are impediments to learning that may be influenced by outside factors which include access to technology, social class, and computer literacy. Culture has a set of implicit rules which are known or recognized by the members of a group. For example, in the Arabic culture children do not make eye contact with adults because it is a form of disrespect, or in Japan people don't speak out of turn or interrupt conversations to interject.  
eLearning has it's set of explicit rules which are accepted by all who opt to use the tool for learning. The rules are clear and expectations are set; the example you shared of obeying traffic lights. Another example of an explicit rule for eLearning is this class; we have clear instructions as to how we should be conducting discussions within this course with our peers.

This definition seems similar to what you guys have already suggested- ""beliefs and norms of a specific group"" or the collective identity of a group.

However, after COVID-19 forced me to deliver a live training via WebEx, I am a bit more open to the idea as online training modules do not have to be dry.

40,Post 3,H,"When I think of culture and eLearning, I think of how to reach cultural communities that may experience difficulties in learning electronically. Some of these groups include rural areas that may not have stable Internet access, groups of people that can’t necessarily afford to purchase high powered technology equipment, and communities that may not be fluent in the language that the learning material is presented in. However, even with the unique hardships that these groups experience, technology can also play a hand in solving them. For example, with the advent of 5G cell service, high speed transmissions are now possible in the most remote of areas and will only continue to grow. What’s more, translation applications have become more and more responsive as of late and gained the ability to translate languages “on the fly”, in some cases right into a wearer’s earbuds. Finally, technology has become so ubiquitous in the past decade that it is becoming reasonably priced for more people than ever to utilize; especially with the development of devices that are designed to pull down data from the cloud such as Chromebooks.
One thing I would like to see in this decade is for technology to become more public, such as kiosks around municipalities that provide information and assistance to an inquirer, sort of like a new style phone booth. These machines would be targeted to individuals who may not carry a smartphone or other mobile computing device.

Accessibility is another issue and not just for English Language Learners, but for students who are on IEPs or need assistance. A lot of web conferencing tools, LMS, or eLearning design programs do not have adequate resources to support accessibility and those that do are very minimal such as close captioning. I can give you a great example of this, back in March when I was still teaching, I had to use Zoom to check-in with my students. I had two Deaf students who were receiving interpreting services from a certified ASL interpreter and it was really hard for us to show our students when I was talking and when she was signing. These are some of the things you would expect at this point should be available, but sadly they are not. 
I like your idea of providing free technology for everyone. Providing citizens with access to the Internet and computers would allow them to seek apprenticeships and certifications that are available for free. Sadly, I do not think this will happen anytime soon but I hope to see this in my lifetime. ",0,2,5,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I see culture as an amalgam of adopted values, language, rituals, and an inherent pride.
eLearning is a tool that enables the creation of an education setting even in places not conducive to learning. eLearning can serve individuals who might otherwise feel outed, vulnerable, or inferior. 
eLearning can offer a forum in which one can be as cultural or a-cultural as one wants to be in conveying content. Since culture is also a part of racial, social, and caste settings, I would posit it represents an opportunity to think about a learning environment that can address racial and social injustice  and delimit caste in a safe zone and place of exploration.
PS: I was just reminded of Margaret Mead's identification of culture not so much being the anthropological artifacts she found but the discovery of a femur that had broken and mended indicating that the individual in question had been cared for and not left to their own devices. That idea permeates the domain of eLearning nicely in the context of creating a circle of care of the intellect or fostering abilities - perhaps demonstrating a vision for what wisdom can do.",3,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

65,Post 7,B,"Electronic learning is the process of acquiring information or skills through modern technology. While what first comes to mind is the notion of a student in front of a computer watching a teacher in another part of town, another part of the country, or another part of the world explain and instruct a topic, as I examine this image, I immediately realize how it's only one facet of e-learning. 
In today's culture, we are all e-learners and many of us have powerful computers in our pockets, able to teach us something at a moment's notice. YouTube is a prime example of this. Gone, in large part, are the days of buying a manual for how to repair your car. With a few good search words, you can find numerous videos showing you how to change a tire, replace a headlight, and even much more complex techniques. Ebook sales are outstripping traditionally printed books and there are many websites where you can simply read a book online instead of downloading it for use in a device like Kindle. Seasame Street has taught young children the alphabet, numbers, and how to be kind for more than 50 years. Netflix is filled with documentaries about astrophysics, cooking, alien abductions, and how to de-clutter your home. The Duolingo app on my phone quizzes me on Spanish words. Skillshare is an online subscription service offering thousands of pre-recorded classes.
We have more access to learning than any other culture in our planet's history. It's so common that it has become second nature and when we use the word ""e-learning,"" most people revert to my original image: that of a formal, live, online class.
Two concepts of culture come to mind when I try to write a definition for this word. The first is a reference to a person's social heritage: the stories and traditions that develop among a group of people. This may be as broad as the history of an ethnicity or tribe or race, or as specific as the recounting of a family's experiences or the mores of a corporation. Culture in this definition is often expressed through how a person dresses, the food they eat, the music they listen to, the way they dance. But it is also, I believe, deeply rooted in their personal identity. For example, I am an American, but if I travel or even move to Arizona, I would say I'm New Mexican because that is how I feel inside, even though I might know Phoenix like the back of my hand (is that even possible?) and cheer for the Cardinals. My native Phoenician neighbor and I might both be American, but she's an Arizonan and I'm a New Mexican.
It occurs to me that we use the word culture to also identify those traits that make someone somehow loftier in terms of education and access to things like art and music. The image that comes to mind (perhaps it's from a movie?) is of well-dressed people attending the opera or an art exhibit opening, sipping champagne and acting very ""cultured."" I think this context also applies to ""cultured pearls,"" so in these examples, culture means polished or rarefied. In my movie, the people are generally white and it makes me wonder if ""culture"" as a polish takes the place of the deeper culture of family history and societal connections that perhaps were lost.",3,0,4,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Both you and Michelle M. made interesting points about seeing culture from a critical perspective.

I like your concluding statement regarding eLearning; I agree that we have to move away from that banking model of education which is what is starting to happen as teachers are moving to eLearning. eLearning, in my opinion, can be the key to transforming our broken education system, but I am concerned that we are continuing to stick to our old ways of teaching which is going to cause further problems in terms of equity and accessibility.

It manifests in all areas of a persons life including how one defines and maneuvers through life and interactions with others. Different influential people and situations can cause culture to shift or evolve. Sometimes the evolution is a result of conflicting aspects of the current culture which can diverge into new groups. Culture then influences the concrete artifacts of life such as language, music, arts etc. which are things that continue to reinforce the feelings of understanding and belonging of those in the group.
When I think of eLearning I feel like it’s a process of figuring out how to build relationships and understanding without the physical and continual proximity we normally have with others we are forming relationships with. So we have to rely on other formats of communicating and exchanging ideas and information to do so. The reinforcing aspects of human physical contact and sharing plays a huge role in the building of culture and belonging so those aspects have to be captured and maintained in other ways in order for it to be successful.
In thinking about how the two concepts relate, I feel that it is about understanding the commonalities, goals and motivations of those in the group. Both also require a recognition and willingness to do the work that is necessary to build understanding and the feeling of belonging and growth within the group in order to meet individual and group needs.",6,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

90,Post 12,Justin Owens,"Culture to me includes a vast array of influences on a person which develops how they view themselves as well as how others view them. These influences include beliefs, norms, language, religion, nationality, color, education level, the community in they were raised, traditions, music, food, and many more. People’s cultures will only become more dynamic as more people from different backgrounds continue to bring their cultures together and pass them down to their offspring.

ELearning is the process by which individuals learn through a variety of electronic mediums to include video, audio, text. It does not always need to be at a distance, however, it is becoming more popular and efficient for teaching and learning to be conducted over the internet.

Culture is related to eLearning as it is a major component to consider when developing online content that will be utilized by a variety of people from different backgrounds. An example of a cultural consideration in developing online content is that of whether the anticipated audience is generally from a high context or low context culture. If they are from a low context culture, such as western countries, they may be used to all information needed to understand the subject material to be explained in writing. Where in a high context culture, like many Asian countries, the audience may be more familiar with learning material that comes with contexts such as tone and body gestures.",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

95,Post 13,P,"I believe that eLearning happens throughout the day, most days. There are many different forums and sites that individuals can access and learn from, without even trying to learn. In an academic setting, this is an eLearning course. There are many apps and forms of social media that are not intended to ""teach"", but end up doing so. There are easily accessible tutorials on Facebook, Youtube, Pinterest, etc., which is so neat. These are often easy to access and do not cost money, which is even better because that means there is more potential for a wider audience to be reached. We are accessing the course lectures and assignments all through electronics. I prefer in-person learning, I like sitting in a classroom and seeing my professor and classmates, but at this time that is not possible. 

Similarly to eLearning, culture can have multiple meanings and can be expressed differently. To me culture is influenced by my upbringing and family/social norms. Some things that seem normal to me, may be foreign to others. I think it is important to learn about other cultures and be accepting even if something is different than the way I do something.

I noticed my greatest concern with these many online opportunities is also the inherent danger of capitalist manipulation/brainwashing through advertising, which is driven by a profit-oriented model, and associated biases being reinforced.

From what I understand from prior studies and experience, I believe culture can be defined as the conglomerate of people/experiences/places/heritage that contributes to a person's creation of self. It includes the influences of such things as family, community, language, socioeconomic status, race, gender, and society. One of the most fascinating aspects of culture for me is the dichotomy between individualistic and collectivistic cultures.

My definition of eLearning begins first with the understanding of learning. For me, I see learning as a process whereby one takes in information, makes connections to that new information, and then shapes it into meaning based on prior knowledge and personal interpretation. Elearning, whether formal or informal,  then layers on the use of electronic materials to span distance divides between teacher and student, such as internet, various online platforms, streaming, and hardware such as laptops/chromebooks.",4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

105,Post 16,G,"I would define culture as the set of values and beliefs that a person uses as a framework for viewing and interacting with the world.  I think a lot of times it tends to get confused with geographic origin, race, ethnicity, spirituality, employment background, age or a number of other areas.  I think all of those things can contribute to a persons culture, but no one of them is the totality of their culture.  For example, I have heard people refer to the ""culture"" of where I grew up (Indiana) or where I live (New Mexico), but I really do not understand what that means when they say that:  There is a lot of diversity in both of those areas.  Indiana is where I grew up, but it doesn't define who I am.  

eLearning is something that is very new to me.  I would have to describe most of my experience with eLearning as really more of ""eTesting"" or ""eDocumenting"":  Where I work, it is used almost exclusively for compliance documentation. It is almost always an on-line power point presentation, followed by a multiple choice test.  I would describe actual eLearning as a non-traditional form of instruction that utilizes technology to overcome barriers of geography and time to allow greater access to education.  But, I may be way off base there.  As I said, this is my first real experience with it.  This class and the other one that I am taking on-line are very new and different to me.  

I think that culture and eLearning are related to each other in that effective eLearning must take into account a very wide range of cultures.  It is likely the widest range in existence.  When students have the potential to come from all stations of life and all corners of the world, that tends to negate a traditional model of education where students often share geographic location, age, employment background or other cultural influences.
