I really like your definition of cultural inclusivity. I would build off of that and add that by starting with mindset that you described, cultural inclusivity is further practiced by valuing ideas that are different than our own. Like you mentioned, we are respectful, and recognize our biases, and through that mindset we take the time to consider ideas that are different. I think it's a step beyond tolerant, to actually find value in what others bring to the table, even if we do not ultimately agree. ",2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks for starting off the discussion! I am tied into my work schedule and will probably not be able to step in during the day over the next week as we move forward.

I am wondering whether we can follow the string of questions that Lani provided and see whether we can approach them as different aspects of one topic and/or if there is a causality that needs to be addressed as move forward to get to a deeper understanding of what cultural diversity is relative to eLearning in the WisCom framework.

I think Justin's summary of our answers will help move along the discussion, so please let us wait for feedback and be sure to check in with where Justin is at in synthesizing what we bring to the table.

Dixie's initial definition with Stephanie's qualification and addition are a great starting point, so I invite everyone to build on Dixie and Stephanie's suggestions - and I assume, we can reference Justin's posts as we build a wider definition, which can move us forward to looking at the theories of learning that support cultural inclusivity.

4,Post 1_3,A,"Hi Everyone, 

Here's my interpretation, I apologize about the length, but I wanted to focus on how we can create a culturally inclusive eLearning experience using the WisCom framework. 

My definition of cultural inclusivity is the act of incorporating cultures into something. In terms of eLearning, this means that an instructor should get to know their students and learn more about their cultures. This allows the instructor to create content that is relevant to everyone and does not contain language barriers and free of stereotypes. As discussed in chapter 1, instructional designers should think about the three levels of adapting a course which are translation, localization, and modularization (Marinetti & Dunn, 2012). This process meets the requirements of creating a culturally inclusive eLearning experience because it is removing cultural barriers that prevent learners from interacting with the content.

Instructional designers can create a culturally inclusive classroom by using the ingredients of the WisCom framework: 

Communication: Through communication, learners can pass on their cultural knowledge to others as opposed to allowing one dominant group to be held responsible for passing on knowledge such as the instructor. It also allows people to understand each other better and help the instructor understand what is needed for learners to be successful and valued within the eLearning community. 
Community: Cultural inclusivity allows for communities to develop where people in an online environment can come together and build a tight-knit group. I noticed how comfortable we are interacting with each other on the discussion boards that when we met for our second Zoom meeting, some of us were interacting like we've known each other for a long time! That is one of the wonderful things about building a community that is culturally inclusive where people respect each other's views and choices.
Technology: We need to be cognizant that not everyone knows how to use a computer, or does not have the bandwidth to do certain things so we need to be patient, teach others, and provide different resources so everyone can meet learning objectives. A culturally inclusive eLearning course does not solely rely on technology; they provide other mediums such as books, handouts, and other resources.
Co-mentoring: We need to work with people of different backgrounds which was something recommended by Tao & Cornell (2003). Co-mentoring is also a great way to provide scaffolding which might be needed for some learners to be successful, and learn from each other.
Problem- solving and collaborative inquiry cycle: It is important to remember that not everyone has the same thought process and some cultures focus more on collaborative thinking than individual thinking (Bentley, Tinney, & Chia, 2005). Culturally inclusive classrooms are a mix of individual and collaborative thinking just like we are doing right now. We are sharing our views and synthesizing them into a summary at the end. 
Wisdom: A ""wise"" instructional designer intentionally creates a culturally inclusive eLearning experience by putting their own culture aside and looking for ways to build a strong learning community
Transformational learning: transformational learning takes place when learning environments allow learners to change their ways of thinking by interacting with learners of a different culture. This is the only way that transformational learning takes place, in my opinion, because sticking to our own beliefs or cultural group will not produce genuine transformational learning because we are not giving up anything. 
Learner support: Cultural inclusivity is all about providing support for the learner. A true culturally inclusive eLearning experience has different support systems for every learner to be successful.

I'm not much of a gamer anymore and I know almost nothing about how to design one, but it is an interesting thought.  Especially in light of what you spoke about right before that.  I have had the same experience with certain apps that you had with the nutrition program.  And that made me think, ""What was the root problem?""  I'd have to say that ""Lack of adaptability"" would probably be the most common source of frustration:  I can't make this thing fit with me and who I am and want to be.  Is an online learning environment essentially just an app?
And, I feel that authenticity and integrity are definitely a legitimate concerns.  I think you are right that we tend to assume that everyone is ""all in"" on both those.  But, that can be a dangerous assumption in some cases.  I'm not even sure it is conscious in many cases. I've been in learning environments with saboteurs ""me firsters""d But, I know in many cases I have seen, there is a reluctance to be honest for fear of being labeled or marginalized because of that honesty.  Examples that I can think of might include the following:
""I'm taking this training because my boss ordered me to take it.  I'd rather be back at my ""real"" job.
""I'm only taking this class because it is required for my major.""
""I think I might be in over my head in this class/training.""
""We aren't even past the introductions and I already feel lost.""
""I think I might be in the wrong room.  Everyone here seems way different/advanced/smarter/etc than me.  I don't feel like I belong here.""

Now, I have actually heard that kind of stuff from students.  But, I think that kind of honesty is kind of rare.  That kind of honesty is hard to get out of people for legitimate reasons.  My experience is that it can be toxic to a learning environment if it isn't addressed.  I'll be honest and say I have no tried and true method of addressing it.

The Collaborative Learning theory supports this goal because mutual participation is at the core of inclusivity.

Though we talk a great deal about the communication side of online course design, what struck me first when considering this question is the very notion that we are talking about a culturally exclusive group of people who even have access to an online environment. Within that framework, the degree of technological access and comfort with platforms varies greatly from person to person.

For example, in Albuquerque, APS has issued Chromebooks to all students this year to guarantee access to the technology since the end of the last term was marked by students not being able to access classes because they did not have a home computer. From my own experience, I find great fulfillment and value in Zoom classes and discussions, but am completely bamboozled by platforms like this one (Learn), which leaves me feeling like I am constantly missing something and can't find what I'm looking for! So cultural inclusivity should include these factors.

A culturally inclusive course design would then encompass the following:

1) A tangible platform that is accessible to all

2) Opportunities for participation are varied and integral to design

I can relate to your experience with various platforms we use for communication and learning. With eLearning being a novel concept, for some, we now have to learn a new language for each program we use to negotiate varying tools and frameworks.

Regarding your definition of cultural inclusivity, ""We can define cultural inclusivity as a guarantee ..."" What happens when a participant is not open to sharing their experiences or elements of their identities or personality to strangers in a virtual environment? How can we guarantee that experience is inclusive? 

In my experience teaching, I found that students from Asian, Middle Eastern, and African ethnic backgrounds found it difficult to share personal attributes about themselves as so much of their identities are based on their parents' accomplishments. In other ethnic groups, Latin Americans (Latinx), perceive talking about themselves as bragging which is frown on in their community. 

In my experience within our Zoom meetings, I realized that I hesitate to speak up because I want to be polite to others and give everyone an opportunity to share their views. In real life, I'm a mid-extrovert and enjoy communicating and contributing to conversations. I learned something new about myself that allowed me to reflect on the meaning of cultural inclusivity and how we communicate in-person versus online.

43,Post 2_2_1_1,C,"Virtual and eLearning are quite distinct from each and in-person. In virtual facilitation, there must be tools to help learners share and contribute to discussions without causing much distraction. Tools for communication should include speaking, using the chat pod, and participating in polls, or asking questions on the screen that require a response (place a stamp on the right answer, etc.). Also, breakout rooms allow participants to communicate in smaller groups.This is a similar format to the strategies I used in the classroom. eLearning requires its set of tools: asynchronous discussions and a set of rules for engagement and a prefixed manner of contributing and submitting work. 

Not every student is an extrovert or is comfortable speaking publicly. Students/learners should be given an equal opportunity to participate in virtual/eLearning sessions using differentiated tools. In an eLearning enviorment, where there is a diverse representation not only in culture but also in varied experience, people should be given a choice in how and when to communicate given his/her/their preference, when appropriate.

Your second paragraph really resonates with me. It seems a lot of guidelines need to be established to give everyone the space they need to interact at their level of comfort. In the peer mentoring process, I think this is a space for personal growth. Learning to be a holistic healthcare practitioner, in all the modalities I offer, the idea is to ""meet your client where they are,"" so I constantly have to adjust treatments to be more or less verbal, more or less ""gossipy"" or ""precise and anatomical,"" more ""touchy feely"" or more ""medical,"" this includes accommodating clients from babies to octogenerians - the health journey these clients entrust me to lead them on is buffered by their knowing they can move at whatever pace they need to in order to let their bodies find portals to self-healing.

Looking at some of the resources in Module 1, I was intrigued to see numerous options for how to read some of the selections -  I would assume these can be considered hands on tools for accommodation.

In spite of these positives, I still can envision the WisCom framework leaving little space for those who cannot assert themselves as well as others so that their input goes under and they give up participating or feel pressured only to participate in order to get a grade/evaluation/or other tangible feedback for which they paid.

Any system with a monetary factor creates a power differential. Maybe WisCom is as altruistic as it may seem not able to truly tap into how e.g. an indigenous wisdom community operaties (taking into consideration the Navajo or Hawaiian models that were discussed).

I feel that I am generally tech savvy, provided I have the time to learn a platform, or that it is at least intuitive.  I agree with your wish list for inclusive course design.  Accessibility is an issue.  The text mentioned that course designers rarely get to choose their LMS platform.  This means when a switch has to be made nearly instantaneously, everyone from the course designer to the facilitator to the student have to adjust quickly, and yes, it is more difficult for some than others.  Also, I think it is awesome that Albuquerque issued ChromeBooks to its students.  However, at my job, some folks had to take non-pandemic work leave when the campus shut down for COVID-19 because they lived in very remote areas with no internet service.

55,Post 3,C,"Culturally inclusivity in an online environment is creating a space where people can learn from the collective experience of others regardless of ethnic or cultural identity.

This space is co-created by all members of the group who communicate and create rules for engagement. This environment is a centralized location where everyone is a contributor and a learner. People bring their wholes selves and everyone's contributions are appreciated and challenged democratically.

The goal of the group is to gain insight into each other's point of view and experience transformational change via learning and shared experiences. The learned concepts are transferrable to various professional and personal aspects of members' lives. 

Creating an inclusive online community requires intention. The designer and creator of the course must have insight into the topics, discussions, backgrounds, and goals of the learners to fully create an inclusive environment.

Elearning has stereotypes associated with content and delivery. The designer intentionally creates a space that is neutral, devoid of personality, to avoid bias. The goal of the designer is not to offend or identify people or to address a particular culture.

The issue with creating a neutral space for learning is that it is not engaging or it may not appeal to learners.

As Melissa shared in her post certain elements are necessary for creating an intentional inclusive experience for learners.

Ultimately it is impossible to create a natural space for learners. The designer will implement his/her/their own bias in developing learner content based on his/her/their understanding of what is ""standard.""

In the Goodfellow and Hewling's reading, they mention that elements of the dominant culture linger in the creation of an eLearning environment and are categorized as ""standard"" in terms of functionality. As we have learned, creating an inclusive experience needs to account for patterns of participation in individualistic and collectivist views as well as high and low context approaches to learning.

In addressing the question on the WisCom Framework I'd like to reference Melissa Herrera's post. 

""Instructional designers can create a culturally inclusive classroom by using the ingredients of the WisCom framework: 

Communication: Through communication, learners can pass on their cultural knowledge to others as opposed to allowing one dominant group to be held responsible for passing on knowledge such as the instructor. It also allows people to understand each other better and help the instructor understand what is needed for learners to be successful and valued within the eLearning community. 
Community: Cultural inclusivity allows for communities to develop where people in an online environment can come together and build a tight-knit group. I noticed how comfortable we are interacting with each other on the discussion boards that when we met for our second Zoom meeting, some of us were interacting like we've known each other for a long time! That is one of the wonderful things about building a community that is culturally inclusive where people respect each other's views and choices.
Technology: We need to be cognizant that not everyone knows how to use a computer, or does not have the bandwidth to do certain things so we need to be patient, teach others, and provide different resources so everyone can meet learning objectives. A culturally inclusive eLearning course does not solely rely on technology; they provide other mediums such as books, handouts, and other resources.
Co-mentoring: We need to work with people of different backgrounds which was something recommended by Tao & Cornell (2003). Co-mentoring is also a great way to provide scaffolding that might be needed for some learners to be successful and learn from each other.
Problem- solving and collaborative inquiry cycle: It is important to remember that not everyone has the same thought process and some cultures focus more on collaborative thinking than individual thinking (Bentley, Tinney, & Chia, 2005). Culturally inclusive classrooms are a mix of individual and collaborative thinking just like we are doing right now. We are sharing our views and synthesizing them into a summary at the end. 
Wisdom: A ""wise"" instructional designer intentionally creates a culturally inclusive eLearning experience by putting their own culture aside and looking for ways to build a strong learning community
Transformational learning: transformational learning takes place when learning environments allow learners to change their ways of thinking by interacting with learners of a different culture. This is the only way that transformational learning takes place, in my opinion, because sticking to our own beliefs or cultural group will not produce genuine transformational learning because we are not giving up anything. 
Learner support: Cultural inclusivity is all about providing support for the learner. A true culturally inclusive eLearning experience has different support systems for every learner to be successful.""

Can we bring the idea of ""idioculture"" into the mix:

An idioculture is a system of knowledge, beliefs, behaviors, and customs shared by members of an interacting group to which members can refer and that serve as the basis of further interaction. Members recognize that they share experiences, and these experiences can be referred to with the expectation they will be understood by other members, thus being used to construct a reality for the participants (Fine, 1987, p.125).

Something that struck me in the various definitions of culture and so diversity was how temporality was addressed in some older ones but then subsumed in more recent definitions; the above definition perhaps encapsulates that in ""being used to construct"" - I am thinking of examples of ever changing language, habits, norms etc. - just as we are now using pronouns to introduce ourselves in many contexts, in German, e.g. the neutral has been added to job listings and such. Do these kinds of changes factor into creating an idioculture as well?

Dixie, I'm glad you've brought the high-context idea into the discussion. What do we want to look for in an idioculture? How does that reinforce or work with cultural diversity?

Even though they may be consistent in application and expectation, we still expect to see ideocultures form amongst the children as small groups find commonalities on other motivations or needs.

WisCom in an instance where an automatic translation was occurring might actually require MORE cultural sensitivity from an instructor because you would need to consider all the ways in which your message could be translated--exhausting thought!

I do think it is important to take into account how many people are in fact bi- and trilingual in the US, however they are mostly societally marginalized and not the dominant group to which education caters based on buying power. In fact, I have seen Americans learn foreign languages much more proficiently and be very humble about it compared, e.g. with Germans who think they command umpteen languages when they don't; and I have definitely experienced language chauvinism in France. European countries have myriad ways of engaging and not engaging in language acquisition; perhaps cultivation of local dialects is something that makes many bi-lingual and living in border towns may turn that into trilingual (e.g. on the Swiss border, Germans speak High German, Allemanish and Schwitzerdütsch) but that's based on history, borders, and trade - just like in the US.

That said, in certain parts of the US it is very discouraging how monolingual people are. But then, even UNM last year cut the requirement for how many semesters one has to study a foreign language and on retiring, the Italian professor and thus the program was cut.

I am very pleased with the discussion so far, and want to thank all of you who have contributed. I would like to ask those who have not yet shared to let us know your perspectives as well.

To add to the previous discussion on defining cultural inclusivity, I feel that inclusion fosters a sense of belonging to a community—feeling appreciated for one’s unique characteristics, perspectives, contributions, and ways of thinking. In inclusive learning environments, participants are encouraged to interact and negotiate meaning with one another. Participants therefore feel comfortable sharing their ideas, their identities, cultures, languages, and ways of seeing the world. We may not know all our learners at the beginning of a course, but if we design online learning environments with cultural inclusivity in mind, by accounting for the expression of different values, beliefs, worldviews, and educational experiences, it will help all learners feel valued, accepted, and respected, contributing to their growth.

I think three important strands of discussion have emerged that warrant further exploration, and some of you have already taken a stab at them.  One of them is the three levels of adapting a course discussed in Chapter 1, translation, localization, and modularization (Marinetti & Dunn, 2012). I argue in favor of localization and cultural contextualization of learning activities rather than globalization, which creates a one size fits all learning design that may not be culturally inclusive. The second strand is defining culture as an idioculture that emerges from the interacting group. How would we design for idiocultures?  The third strand is the role of language. I feel that second language speakers are usually challenged in asynchronous discussions.  Would “translanguaging” or allowing for the full repertoire of a person’s linguistic expression be the answer? How can we address this? I hope to see further discussion on these great ideas you have brought up.

In addition, I would encourage you to take a critical look at the WisCom framework. Some of the questions, I have in mind are:  To what extent does it help us to design with cultural inclusivity in mind.? What type of learner would thrive in a WisCom learning design, and who would feel left out? What is missing in WisCom? How can we improve it?

In response to your point about translanguaging, I definitely agree that second language speakers are at a disadvantage in classroom discussions, however I do not have a definitive answer for whether I feel it should be allowed in the classroom. I think to some extent it almost has to be allowed so that students can fully express what they know, but my question is: how will the teacher know what they are expressing if they do not know the other language, and if that is the case is it still worthwhile? I'm curious to hear what my classmate think.

In my family, a lot of us speak a form of Spanglish (Spanish and English mix) when were are together. However, I have never felt comfortable to use it in an academic situation. My reasoning for this is probably fear of feeling ostracized because we are expected to use academic English in school. The difference for me however is that English is my first language, so I don't feel like I need the support of Spanglish or Spanish to express my ideas, but if I was working in a Spanish speaking community I would definitely feel more comfortable using English sometimes or at least some Spanglish.

85,Post 7_2_2_1,B,"Thanks for the reminder prompt, Eva!

I've actually been thinking a lot about what types of learners would thrive in a WisCom learning design and who might feel left out. At first, I considered that the framework was universal enough that anyone could thrive in it. But then someone (I think it was Mark) mentioned that sometimes he didn't speak up in online classes as much as he might because he was trying to be polite and allow other people to speak. This then got me to thinking about people who might be shy or introverted and feel awkward participating in an online discussion, and then I wondered about people who may have other factors that make participating in a collaborative program untenable. 

For example, I have a child who suffered crippling depression and anxiety (with a host of sub-diagnoses) in high school. We had to get a 504 accessibility plan to enable them to take time off when in a bad state or take longer to turn in an assignment. I'm not certain it would have been possible to enact such a plan if the learning was in an online collaborative environment. Now it might be easy to say, ""well then those people shouldn't take an online class"" but I think this limits the scope of what WisCom seeks to do which is to provide transformative learning. 

This may not seem like a ""cultural"" issue, but I'm referencing the article ""Reconceptualizing Culture in Virtual Learning"" and the idea that ""Culture conceptualized in terms of nationality or of ethnicity is limited usefullness in understanding interpersonal interaction because of complexity of influences and determinants within an individual."" So essentially, I'm proposing that social and mental health issues fit as a ""culture"" to be considered in designing a learning platform.

Perhaps what needs to be included in cases like this are options of participating more asynchronously (like this very forum) and the ability to perhaps turn off the camera and only use chat in instances like Zoom meetings. The collaborative side of WisCom may need to consider that some people are not always able to work collaboratively.

Not only may translanguaging give students the confidence to do well, it seems that this method would also help students learn the new second language more quickly as it gives meaning and context (the importance of which someone mentioned in a previous thread) to what they are trying to translate.  I can also see it helping students learn as they must be engaged through all three steps as translation for a non-native speaker of a language requires total focus.  This may also have an advantage to native speakers of course's language, which would be to have them be more engaged with the material as well as they try to explain the nuances and context of their language to the non-native speaker.  Come to think of it, I have had friends where English was not their primary language, and it did force me to look at the material more in depth so I could answer their questions more thoroughly than I would have with another native English speaker.  Finally, it seems as if translanguaging would soften the mentor-mentee boundary.  Wow!  I am super excited!

100,Post 10,G,"What does it mean to be culturally inclusive in online course design?
I found the idea of breaking this down in several questions to be very helpful when approaching this task.

1.  I define cultural inclusivity in terms of a learning environment or instructional design.  With that approach, my definition would require two presuppositions:

a.  Internalization of knowledge is both a social and individual process (Vygotsky).

b.  Learning takes place within the social and cultural context of the learner.

(Gunawardena/Frechette/Layne 2019).

Therefore, I would define cultural inclusivity as using these presuppositions as the basis to design the learning environment for maximum accessibility.  The environment must recognize that social and cultural contexts can be radically different from student to student.

2.  I think that the theories of learning that support cultural inclusivity are the social cultural perspective and, partially by embracing the later, WisCom.  By recognizing the importance of zones of proximal development, distributed cognition and communities of practice they recognize that learning proceeds from the social level to the individual level and takes place within the social and cultural context of the learner.  Rather than fighting this, WisCom is able to design a culturally inclusive learning environment.
3.  Cultural inclusivity is reflected in online course design by creating a framework which is built upon the foundation of the social cultural perspective and/or WISCOM.  By incorporating those principles into the foundation, a well-designed online course framework is more likely to be culturally inclusive if it does the following:

a. It would recognize that all learning in the online environment will begin at the social level, and then transfer to an individual level.  So, it would create a strong community of practice (a collaborative cognition device) as quickly as possible.

b.  It would recognize that the online environment is likely to contain the most diverse set of social cultural perspectives possible.  For this reason, it would need to be very careful to avoid bias in its construction or operations.
b.  It will embrace that the students may all be in a different zone of proximal development and use that as a strength, not a handicap.  Mentoring plays an enormous role in this in my experience.

c.  It would recognize the transactional distance of different learners and seek to minimize that by reducing structure, simplifying structure that cannot be eliminated and increasing dialogue between members of the community of practice.

4.  The most significant way the WisCom framework helps me think about cultural inclusivity in online design is through its contrast with the community of inquiry (COI) model.  The COI focuses on the individual construction of knowledge.  In an online environment, the COI model would be very difficult to manage or monitor.  WisCom, focuses not on the individual construct, but the group construct.  This seems more in line with the theory of social cultural perspective in learning.  Placing the “wisdom community” at the center of the model is evidence of this. That model, where there are multiple “check ins” by multiple learners and multiple mentors, all of whom may switch roles frequently, sounds much more effective and more accepting of the social cultural model of learning.

I’m sorry if this is a ramble.  I found these chapters of the book very interesting, as I have encountered problems in instructional design which directly relate to some of the theories that are discussed here.

104,Post 11_1,G,"I appreciate what you had to say there.  I sometimes find myself explaining to a customer, ""Ultimately, a person who knows nothing about this subject should be able to take this course and do as well as someone with a great deal of knowledge about it or its general area of knowledge.""  But, I think you are expanding that further and I like that.  It sounds like I need to broaden that out to, ""A person who know nothing about this subject AND who has never been in a learning environment like this before...""  Thanks for that insight. I find that valuable.",0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
105,Post 11_2,F,"I really like how you defined cultural inclusivity. You did a great job summing it up. The part that you included about the different viewpoints needing to be accounted for at the start of a project in order to ensure equity to all learners. I think this is a very important part. I am currently using a program called Edgenuity for my chemistry curriculum and one of the reasons I chose to use it is because I have a variety of students with various disabilitlies such as hearing impaired, dyslexic, and sensory processing disorders, as well as have students whose primary language is Spanish, and this program was designed to be used by all, which has been awesome because I am able to meet the needs of all of my students! It is very frustrating as an educator to be teaching and not have necessary supports to help support all of my students, so when a program comes along that accounts for all of these things and ensures equity for all it's awesome.",2,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1
106,Post 11_3,N,"This format of discussion is a bit overwhelming for me. Sifting through over 100 posts and replies is a little crazy, but there are a lot of great comments to uncover. I stopped right away when I read your response - I wanted to reply because I really appreciate the way you propose concrete strategies for cultural inclusivity such as translation, audio, and vocabulary software within a course. I also agree that one of the most important tenants fo the WisCom framework is the reliance on collaboration amongst learners. In fact, this idea seems to crop up in my life over and over in all of the professional contexts I move within, from the peer-to-peer focus my school maintains in order to support ELL students, to the learning I gained from my courses over the summer, and again here in the ideas behind the WisCom Framework.",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
107,Post 11_3_1,K,I agree that this discussion format is overwhelming.  It's hard to pick up a conversation thread or have any true back and forth interaction.  Perhaps there are ways to communicate and collaborate more effectively.  Do you (or anyone else) have any suggestions for improvement?  ,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

109,Post 12,E,"We are still looking forward to hearing from Becky, Justin, and Tanya. Referring to Dr. Lani's post, I think some of the discussion points she suggested looking at further have been addressed, so perhaps you could look at the other line of questioning she encouraged, which all of us will probably be thinking about a lot throughout this course!

""In addition, I would encourage you to take a critical look at the WisCom framework. Some of the questions, I have in mind are:  To what extent does it help us to design with cultural inclusivity in mind.? What type of learner would thrive in a WisCom learning design, and who would feel left out? What is missing in WisCom? How can we improve it?""

110,Post 13,N,"Based on the definition of culture from Harris & DeSimone as a “set of shared values, beliefs, norms, and artifacts” which guide behavior, being culturally inclusive in online course design can refer to providing multiple means of dissemination of information, interaction with course material and peers, and production and/or assessment. Differentiating an online course in such a manner allows for students of differing cultures to interact with each other, the content, and their professor(s) in authentic and meaningful ways by creating room for the interplay of the multitude of cultural dimensions, including such aspects as high context vs low context, masculine vs. feminine, collectivism vs individualism and so forth. Thus, within the idioculture of a group of cohorts in an online class there is room for individual expression while maintaining functional communication in the online learning environment and thereby fostering increased cross-cultural understanding and a safe cultural space for elearning. When learners have the safety to interact with each other, across cultural barriers, in order to collaborate on complex problems, resulting learning may be transformative leading to the cultivation of online wisdom communities.
