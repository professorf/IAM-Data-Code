U1,"So, I know we were supposed to wait for U13 to post but, I was getting too nervous waiting on her first post and I couldn't wait any longer... I will bite the bullet on this one...
So, for this discussion we were asked to define culture and eLearning. To me, culture is the way in which people live life based off of their upbringing, attitudes, values, beliefs, morals and traditions. Culture is something that we are born into and then throughout our life it is something that we shape into ourselves and modify to our likings. This is somewhat similar to the definition we were given in The Meaning of Culture in Online Education: Implications for Teaching, Learning and Designs “that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society” (Tyler, 1871, p.1). It may be a very old definition of culture, but it one that most people (me included) can relate to and understand. To me eLearning is when a student learns in the online environment. This is usually done through various ways, such as from a computer, a phone, tablet etc. But nevertheless, they all require one thing, internet access! Now the hard question is stating how culture and eLearning are related. I could go on and say how they’re related with my opinion, but I think I’ll just stick to the readings. According to Goodfellow and Hewling, Culture and eLearning are related in many ways or culture has a way of shaping itself within the eLearning environment. For example, there was a study done that looked at three different nationalities (Korean, Finnish and American) and it looked at their cultural differences and the characterizations amongst these groups within an online learning environment. It was found that American students were more individualist when it came to being in an online course. They showed more interest in themselves and their needs. It was also found that Americans were more action-oriented when it came to finding results. Whereas students from Japan, China or Arab countries were considered collectivistic because they would put the interests of their families and community before theirs. Finns were found to be “more group focused and reflective” (Goodfellow and Hewling, p.357). While, Koreans were found to be more social when it came to online learning. So, you see our upbringings, traditions, beliefs and ways of living not only play a part in our daily lives when it comes to our wellbeing and ways of life. But they also come out when we are learning. Whether we are learning in a classroom or in an online environment our culture plays a huge role. So, this pretty much explains why some people “don’t play well with others”, because they probably didn’t get much interaction with people at home or in their community. This also explains why some people are great with working with groups or even with a certain age range of people (they are around them more, they are taught to respect those kinds of people and they were taught how to work well with others and they probably have good experiences with doing so). I think the best example I have to share with you all about culture having/playing a role in the online/face-to-face learning environment would be last semester I worked with a small group of people and one of my group members was very religious. Because she was respective of her religion she was unable to do certain things on certain days throughout the week or touch technology etc. on certain days. For example, she was a full-time student and part time worker, but she was not allowed to touch, talk, work or do anything related to school or work on Sundays. She was to go to church from 6am to noon and then back home to prey, clean and get ready for the week. So, for our class projects we had to try and get everything done early in the week. Including talking to her because she was not able to use her phone or computer on that day either. Neat huh?",11,0,0,0,0,21,9,4,0,2,77,0,0
U2,"My definition of culture is the values, norms, beliefs (religious), and familial interactions and behavioral edicts that shaped me into the person I am today. In reflecting on my upbringing, my father was a strong disciplinarian and kept my sister and I in line so to speak. There were acceptable behaviors and non-acceptable behaviors and consequences and rewards for both. There were also strong familial interactions with my aunts and uncles whom I spent a lot of time with growing up. The time spent with them reinforced the way I was being taught at home. Since I was the youngest in my family, there was a lot expected of me as opposed to my sister. As I look back now, i'm guessing the reason for this was maybe my parents felt they could have made different decisions where my sister was concerned and therefore didn't want to make those same decisions with me.
As far as elearning goes, there is the obvious definition of distance learning/education via a computer with an internet connection but I believe it goes further than that in that there needs to be an attempt to engage the learner through activities, discussions, interactions etc. Until now, I had not thought of culture as having an affect on distance eduction and eLearning. Most of the distance education courses I have taken focus on the standard norms such as discussions based off of rubrics and my weekly participation. Both were things that were very important parts of my grade. I don't feel that I really was being held to any specific learning other than meeting the basic requirements of the rubric. I ask myself now, how much learning really occurred? I can understand better after completing the readings how culture can influence learning and probably affected how I learned in previous courses. American culture in general seems to focus on the immediate here and now learning and getting things done quickly, working towards the rubric or assignment requirements and doing exactly what needs to be done to complete the course and hopefully get an A. I've taken courses online that at times have made me feel that I'm merely going through the motions to meet course requirements rather than gaining any additional knowledge. 
I agree with U21 that Americans are definitely more individualistic. I think this applies in school but also in work environments. In my experience, culture in learning in school or work favors individuals as opposed to groups. Collaboration is attempted but never really accomplished. After completing our readings, I am starting to have a better understanding about the reasons for individualistic focuses on distance ed and am eager to learn more about how to overcome this and move towards more collaborative learning and teaching methods going forward.

U3 ,"Hi U4,
I want to quote your reflection on the American culture that you inherited and how you bring that to your online learning.You mentioned that "" American culture in general seems to focus on the immediate here and now learning and getting things done quickly, working towards the rubric or assignment requirements and doing exactly what needs to be done to complete the course and hopefully get an A. I've taken courses online that at times have made me feel that I'm merely going through the motions to meet course requirements rather than gaining any additional knowledge."" I really like how you actually reflected your e-Learning experience from your own culture. Being a foreign national myself (Chinese) and having been in the U.S. for 12 years, I hardly heard any Americans reflect on their own cultures and how that could influence their learnings and their relationships with others. I think for one, we are in the U.S., so as an American people don't generally think about how their own culture can affect other cultures. I suppose if an American goes to Europe or Asia, or any other countries, they may start comparing their own culture with others' culture and gain lots of insights on the relationships between culture and all other aspects of life. 
I want to reflect on how my own culture has affected my learning in general. I grew up in China until I was 16, and in Chinese culture we do focus a lot on taking the time to reach your own goals. Now, China nowadays has become more and more like the Western cultures, where people pursue immediate results and accomplishments without putting a lot of time and energy into their work. However, when I grew up in China in the 90s and 2000s, my education and the teaching I received from my parents were to really focus on building solid foundations for whatever I did. After I came to the U.S. and started college, one thing that I noticed I had that was very different from domestic students was that I put a lot of time reading textbooks. It was almost like an OCD that I had to read my textbooks or do all of the assigned readings before I make an argument or write a paper. I hardly saw that in American students, and I believe that the ""freedom of speech and doing everything"" aspect in American culture really encouraged domestic students to quickly voice their judgments and opinions without having a lot of background information. There is truly no right or wrong. I see advantages and disadvantages in both choices. 
Thank you for bringing up a good point that in turn made me reflect on how my culture affected my learning.

U4,"Hi U3,
Thank you for sharing some of your culture and background with me. Chinese culture has always intrigued me and I'm a bit disappointed to find out the culture has leaned more towards our Western culture. I hate to admit that in some cases I've experienced and relied upon my American culture to help me complete a course. I am always hopeful that American culture will keep evolving. I feel over the last twenty years or so, there has been an emphasis on learning quickly, getting the degree and getting a good job. Thus the many instances of completely online universities offering more on line college courses or the ability to complete a degree in 2 years rather than 4 years etc. My feeling is this societal expectation that we move quickly through school, lives, work etc. has contributed to less learning taking place. I may be wrong and freely admit this is my personal opinion based on observations, but I'm wondering when and where we started moving away from valuing the effort and commitment it takes to even attend college, obtain a degree, thoughtfully find a job that fits in with the type of degree obtained and work towards an end goal. Anyway, thank you for expressing your observations and feelings about my post and American culture. I appreciate it.

U5,"Hi U4 and U3, 
I wanted to jump in because I find this perspective on culture fascinating. Americans can indeed be culture centric. Many of us do not realize the influence of American culture on our daily lives until we are placed in a culture that operates differently. When I volunteered and lived in South America for a year, I found that one of the most common phrases I used when talking to my local friends in the first few months was ""In mi cultura..."" and then I would explain what was causing me culture stress. Without realizing it, I was trying to operate off of American culture norms and I expected my Colombian friends to do the same. By explaining ""in my culture, we do ______"", I expected them to understand why the way that we did things was normal. Eventually, I began to see that their eyes would glaze over and that I wasn't going to change the way they managed their time or approached higher education. They had other priorities and I eventually saw the difference in culture as a beautiful thing! I like the term, ""culture stress"" because I think that this captures living in a foreign culture much better than culture shock. There are some things from your home culture that you never let go of (i.e. reading textbooks, U3!) and there are some things that you adapt to. Trying to overcome the standard operating procedure you have grown up with to fit in with the norms around you is stressful! The important part is to go in with an open mind. Know where you are coming from and respect where someone else is at. It took me almost the full year to realize this but I feel thankful for the opportunity to see that the American Way is not the only way to live life!

I find other cultures fascinating and always wonder what must other countries think of Americans? Did you find that South American culture was less driven? What I mean by that is it seems like we as Americans are always expecting more from ourselves and each other where in other countries, my assumption is there may be ambition but it's acceptable to not be as worried about drive and there are different goals that motivate the culture. Is that correct? I'm curious what you thought were similarities and differences between American and South American culture?

U6,"Hi U4,
I was the eldest in my family and feel like my parents, as well as other family members, expected a lot out of me because I was the oldest of five. I had more rules, discipline, and responsibility to be a good example for the others and all of my mistakes were broadcasted throughout my family to make sure I did not make them again. I think it is interesting that my parents thought I should be perfect, but were much less strict with the younger children. I always felt that they must have seen or realized the pressure was just too much to put on me, so they were lenient with the others. I never thought about how it would be for the youngest child in a family. My baby sister was, and remains, the free spirit in the family who has not quite figured it all out yet, but I wonder if she felt pressure as a child to be perfect or not do all the dumb things we did.

U7,"Culture is a constantly evolving and live concept. I agree with many of the definitions in the powerpoint presentation. I especially like the adaptation from Gary Alan Fine, which states that it is “shared by members of an interacting group”. I believe an established or inherited culture remains active and passed on because it is practiced, cherished and built upon by each individual. Harris & DeSimone called it a “set of shared values, beliefs, norms, and artifacts” and Matsumoto also referred to culture as a “set of attitudes”. I think they are both right. I personally share a different set of attitudes as work then I do at home or church. The values and beliefs remain the same for me, but they are practiced very differently in each culture in which I participate. I appreciate that artifacts were also mentioned because I do believe some cultures are derived from this concept. For example, my beliefs and values are derived from the lessons of the bible, though I believe it to be a telling of true events, it is still considered an artifact of my faith and my culture of living. Similar artifacts of culture could be cellphones and the culture they have created for social media or perhaps how coffee or wine and the different culture settings they create. A person can participate in many different cultures, while still maintaining a consistent set of attitudes of their own culture.

U3 ,"Culture
To me, I see two essential parts of culture. On a macro scale, I agree with Margaret Mead's (1932) definition, that culture is ""the whole complex of traditional behavior which has been developed by the human race and is successively learned by each generation"". On a micro scale, as many have mentioned here in the forum, culture also includes a person's unique intake, involvements, and developments from what that person grew up with from the past generations. This would in turn evolve into a ""one's culture"", not just ""culture"". 
As an example, since I grew up in China until I was 16, I do see lots of Chinese values in me no matter how old I get. Modesty, hatred toward pride, respect to the elders, feeling unsure about my own opinions until a superior power affirms my values, and even dressing modestly. That's part of the ""culture"" that I experience and inherit. In addition to that, coming to the U.S. at an early age and becoming a first-generation Christian in my family, I have certainly developed ""my own culture"". This part makes me entirely unique from the others, even from those who grew up similarly as I did. Now I journal and dream in a mixture of English and Mandarin languages. The free spirit I gained after being in the U.S. for a long time offered me a fresh and bold new take in understanding the Bible and building churches. The part that I inherited from my traditional Chinese culture has integrated with my own experiences surviving in a new country and choose a spiritual pursuit that can be totally misunderstood by people around me.

E-Learning 
E-learning is a way of learning and teaching that includes learners learn through interactions with the contents and the whole learning community through the Internet. I want to emphasize on the fact that e-Learning focuses on the ""distance"" aspect, that the main communications and interactions among people and learning contents are online. A hybrid learning environment includes both F2F and learning through the Internet, however, it is not the involvement of the Internet that could quality a learning as ""e-Learning"". Rather, it is the involvements of the Internet plus a distinct Internet communication and interaction that completes the definition of e-Learning. ",1,3,0,1,0,9,5,6,2,2,45,12,0.164383562
U10,"Hello classmates,
In my opinion, culture is defined as one’s relationships, values, attitudes, traditions, and behaviors. Culture can be considered complex since it consists of social groups who share the same knowledge, belief, morals, and customs. Another way to view culture is by set patterns, feelings, and ways of thinking. Our classmate, U21, made an excellent point regarding how people are born into the culture. For example, since I am taller than the average height, I was instantly placed in the “tall person” culture which consists of the question, “Do you play basketball?”.
Electronic learning (eLearning) can occur in a traditional setting or via the Internet in an online setting. In the traditional classroom setting, eLearning would consist of a PowerPoint presentation or video/films. Online eLearning is considered as a web-based course comprised of discussions, videos, quizzes offered an online platform such as Moodle or Blackboard. One area that culture and eLearning have in common is the fact that both are constantly changing. Personally, when I think of eLearning and culture, I think of introversion and extraversion. I am curious on whether people who tend to be more introvert find themselves in online programs instead of traditional programs. Of course, there are other reasons why people choose online versus traditional learning, but from a related cultural perspective, introversion/extraversion and eLearning are a prime example.

U12,"Hi U10, and thanks U6 and U11 for interjecting your perspectives. 
I think a lot of this depends on how you define introversion, and also understanding that although someone may be introverted or extroverted, we can all be ""trained"" or socially programmed into the opposite of what we naturally are. I think that American culture rewards extroversion over introversion; Americans tend to be offended if someone doesn't smile or say hello, where as if you do that in even other western countries like Russia or the U13ce, you're frowned upon. I think other cultures view extroversion as offensive or intrusive, and reward more humble presentation of self, or deference to elders, as U3 mentioned she experienced growing up in China. (U3, I hope I'm capturing that accurately!)
I learned one definition of introversion that really resonated with me. It's understood that introverts ""recharge"" when they are alone, while extroverts actually gain energy by being with other people. 
Many people would describe me as an extrovert. I do well in group settings, I can be called upon to present to large groups without much notice and be fine, and I enjoy meeting new people. However, if I don't get some time to myself, my entire being suffers. I can't recalibrate and recharge. I know that my Italian-American heritage very much expects one to be extroverted, and it was something my family encouraged growing up. It was only in my late 20s that I realized that although I enjoy people, I really do need time alone to feel balanced and re-energized. 
U6, although I am an introvert, this is my first online class. So far, I've enjoyed the way that Lani and Bri Ramirez have setup the course, but it's certainly outside of my comfort zone! I actually think that the amount of time and attention that you have to spend online reading the discussion boards, which are about pretty intimate topics, takes more energy for me to accomplish than finishing the readings and assignments outside of class, and attending a seminar like discussion during class and engaging the professor and classmates. 
I wonder if anyone else has thoughts on this. Thanks again for sharing! ",0,2,2,0,0,11,6,10,1,2,59,16,0.219178082
U13,"I believe that people's belief, used as artifacts, are the way we communicate with our families. From one generation to the other is what defines culture. I believe culture defines our worldview that sets boundaries between them. However, the concept of culture means different things to different people. Some people use a mental map that guides their relations to their surroundings and other people. Culture, when shared by a large number of people produce a spiritual, material or non-material aspect of human life that gives people a sense of direction and differentiates them from other groups and societies. I believe culture is learned not inherited. 
Culture, to me, influences the beliefs and values of designing and interacting in eLearning. I believe the design of the value system has influenced the lessons we have learned in growing up. I uphold my value systems, and they influence the way I communicate with others and the way I learn. Once I became aware of my cultural makeup, it was easier to understand cultural differences. I further understand the differences from my own life experiences. 
A person's characteristics, motivation, do they find the content interesting, and their attitude towards the learning. One's definition of culture determines how culture will play a role in how they will adapt to eLearning. The following quote captured the essence of culture for me. 
""Culture flashes on the goodness that acknowledges. practices, and passes from one to later generations. (Nienghatai Kopholklang, 2545).

U14,"Culture
To me culture, in the context of human beings, is how a person associates and identifies him/herself with other similar people. Association can be in the form of things such as the foods you eat, or ways of conducting oneself such as wiping your rear end with toilet paper (kind of a wasteful, expensive, and silly idea when you analyze it). Culture also contains non-material elements such as values, societal belief patterns, which lead to policies form civilizations. For example, in many parts of the United States you cannot buy alcohol at 10am on Sunday. Why is that? Logic would state that is because it is the law. Probably though, that law was influenced by the dominate Protestant Christian society in positions of power that decided that people should be in Churches on Sunday morning. 
Something new I learned from the readings about culture was Hofstede’s five dimensions of culture (Edunson, Andrea (2006). I haven’t seen some of these categories displayed as bipolar scales. I question if these categories are still relevant in the form of a scale now that understandings of topics like gender continue to mutate away from a normative binary. 

Elearning
To me, Elearning is a buzzword from the 90s when companies realized they can train people through computers. This week’s readings about online learning seemed like academics are trying to be able to quarantine the concept and study it. Yet, I think the average day user of technology, such as the internet, just considers online life as part of normal life. This is the way our civilization acquires information now. Perhaps, if we study online learning as an evolution of communication and culture, we might find different insights then trying to bucket it into a specific topic. 
As to U13's question, ""would developing eLearning and teaching models which match to the user's perception promote acceptance to eLearning in different cultures?""
Many large tech companies, in particular social media companies such as Facebook, are very concerned with this idea that learning online be too catered to one's perception or vision of the world. There is a fear of people will create reinforce their biases and believes and potentially leading to a more fragmented and divided society. Yet, the irony of it all is how these companies find themselves in a rock and a hard place because they only survive by user engagement. User engagement tends to be highest when algorithms present articles that the user loves or hates. I think it will be important for us as instructors to facilitate spaces where people can constructively participate in discourse. ",3,1,1,0,0,11,5,6,1,1,53,18,0.246575342
U15,"I love the conversation here – I have found that each time I went to respond, I pondered to consider another perspective. It is interesting to me that we are talking about finding the meaning of culture in at least three areas - (1) being a part of a culture, (2) creating cultures (3) navigating cultures different than our own. 

U14 mentioned from our reading Hofstede’s Five Dimensions of Culture (Edunson, Andrea, 2006). After reading his post I went online to read more about the dimensions (now six dimensions). 
I read an article putting the dimensions into context (ironic given that we have talked about culture and context). Link to article here: https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&context=orpc

What particularly struck me was the Power Distance Index (PDI), which refers to the power differential in a culture. At the above link go to page 9 at the bottom and the table gives examples of power differences.
On Wikipedia it discusses the scores that countries were given using this scale and the United States scored basically in the middle, where Guatemala scored high, and Isreal scored low.
Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstede%27s_cultural_dimensions_theory

U20 shared how culture can have a positive or negative impact on society. Given the scoring mechanism I can see how culture, values, etc. can lead to that interpretation given the scoring of power, masculinity, etc. It reminds me of how in some places where I train respect is given with a firm handshake and looking someone in the eye directly, whereas in other places that can be perceived as incredibly disrespectful. Like in the video regarding Navajo Nation, if we only look at culture through our lens (and draw meaning on behaviors based on our perceptions), we may be interpreting great cultural strengths as weaknesses. For instance, the way western culture views traditional healing, etc. as alternative (not recognized, or billable as a service).

U13 posed the question ‘would developing eLearning and teaching models which match to the user's perception promote acceptance to eLearning in different cultures?’
It seems to me that in order to address cultural differences you must learn as much from the participants as they are expecting to learn in the learning environment. From a previous course we learned that adult learners increase competence when attaching new concepts to previous knowledge/experiences. This can be done by using common knowledge, or imagery, that participants can identify with and add competence to. But what is common to one, may not be to another. For instance, in Hawaii when I work with native communities it is common to use the ocean and waves as an example to apply learning to. Outside of that community/culture it may not be as affective.

There have been so many good definitions of culture thus far – I’d just like to add that I think of culture as the intersections of beliefs, values, experiences, age, food, traditions, ceremonies, etc. The intersections can be incredibly varied, and change throughout time. When we take our intersections of culture and apply them on top of another, it not only increases misunderstanding but also we miss out on expanding our own world view and opportunity to learn. 
I believe it is critical to practice empathy in an eLearning environment, as Brene Brown says, to honor that my humanity is connected to yours. We can disagree, and be respectful, and learn, etc.",2,2,1,1,1,27,8,10,2,3,57,19,0.260273973

U3,"U14,
I really appreciate your logical response to U13's question. It is so interesting that social medias both encourage and fear users' unique perceptions. That actually allowed me to compare the Chinese government vs. the U.S. government. The former fears citizens' unique opinions and biases because they are terrified with not being able to manage such a huge country. The latter encourages uniqueness and individualities to such an extent that nobody knows what's right any more, or at least what is truthful. This is such a hard balance to create.

U16,"To me culture is the set of ideas, behaviors, attitudes, and traditions that exist within large groups of people (usually of a common religion, family, or something similar). These ideas, behaviors, traditions, etc. are passed on from one generation to the next and are typically resistant to change over time. Cultures vary widely not only across the world, but even right next door. 
To me e-learning came about in the 80's around the time the internet was created and is a learning system based on classical teaching but with the help of electronic resources. While teaching can be based in or out of the classroom, I think the use of computers and the Internet forms the major elements of E-learning. I also think that e-learning can also be termed as a the transfer of skills and knowledge, and the delivery of education is made to a large number of recipients at the same or different times. 
In response to U13's question, ""would developing eLearning and teaching models which match to the user's perception promote acceptance to eLearning in different cultures?"" I think it would; and I may be way off the mark here, but just as different American companies have opened businesses around the world but they have adapted and tweaked their services to be culturally accepted in various parts of the world. So that said, I think that eLearning can do the same as long as the cultural norms are respected.

U5,"To carry on the great conversation started by U21 and U4, I want to tie in my perspective on eLearning culture. Have you noticed the slightly different culture that forms in each OILS course that you have taken within the online discussion groups? Much of this culture comes from set norms by the students and expectations communicated by the Instructor. Even in an environment where we only know each other by voice and written word, we still tend to form a culture that mirrors our values. I am interested to hear your take on how you have seen various eLearning culture shifts in your different OILS courses. What was the driving factor for the difference?
Culture
In a strange comparison, defining culture reminds me of how you would explain the reason you've chosen the haircut you wear today. Almost everyone has a different hair cut or hairstyle that has been acquired through socialization and personal choice. It can reflect customs, conformity, or artistic expression. In the same way, Culture is a set of religious, artistic, environmental, or habitual values you have adapted through your lifespan. Although it is part of who you are today, it can be changed throughout your lifetime to match the way you perceive you fit in in the world. Culture is an attempt to satisfy our need to know where we belong among the people around us. Culture shock comes when we realize that we do not fit in with the norms around us. We either much hold on the our contradicting habits and accept culture stress, conform, or attempt to influence those around us. I enjoyed the simplicity in Sir Edward Tylor's definition of culture; "" the complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, customs, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."" (Tylor, 1871, pg. 1) Culture is acquired and is very much a social construct influenced by co located people. As my husband and I consider moving to the foreign culture of the Pacific Northwest, I have spent much time thinking about how we will adjust. 
eLearning
I have thought quite extensively about eLearning as this was the topic of my Capstone Internship. eLearning is better defined as distance education. Even though eLearning is still a very popular buzz word, it is just another medium for teaching information electronically across any distance. eLearning has the benefit that it is electronically communicated and can therefore be replicated or manipulated to best fit the needs of the learners it aims to teach. Since the environment does not make interpersonal communication as natural as a face-to-face course, the culture of the course needs to be set upfront with respect as a mandatory expectation and an openness to cultural differences.

U7 ,"HI U5,
I appreciate your exploration of distance learning. I especially like your statement that eLearning ""can therefore be replicated or manipulated to best fit the needs of the learners it aims to teach"". I find a lot of inspiration and creativity can be expressed through distance learning. However, based on some of my experiences, I would have to disagree that eLearning ""does not make interpersonal communication as natural as a face-to-face course"".  A few semesters ago, I took a course on virtual learning environments. In that course, we were assigned an avatar and met in a virtual learning space. The space was fully customizable and felt completely interactive. After the first couple of sessions, I noticed that we (our avatars) treated each other as we would in a traditional classroom. If our avatars would accidentally bump, we'd apologize to each other as if we'd actually bumped our neighbor. Our avatars walked in small groups, some alone, as you would expect in real life. We were even able to have individual study sessions while sitting at the beach or by a firepit. It was a very unique and extremely personal experience. We formed relationships with each other even though we were still all sitting in front of our computers. While there are limitations to eLearning, there are also many avenues to create culture and interpersonal communication. Great post.",1,0,0,1,0,5,5,2,2,0,35,25,0.342465753

Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts on this! Although this is my first online class, and therefore I guess you could argue my first formal eLearning experience, I do run some online forums for Project ECHO's partners. I've noticed that while some people are more comfortable speaking in person or on the phone, many are much more comfortable emailing. Similarly, I would say that the online platform allows others that are not as comfortable speaking in person to interact more if it's online. I know many colleagues and friends who suffer from social anxiety, and who bristle at the thought of being called on in class or put on the spot in meetings. Although this is something I am accustomed to (perhaps from the American culture I've been reared in?  ), I wonder if this online communication is more natural for others. Perhaps online learning and forums have changed the way we communicate so much so that they now have a firm place in American culture. What do you all think?

U4 ,"U5,
You make a great point about how culture really can be a matter of what or who we identify with. In my childhood, while i came from a two parent household, I spent a lot of time with relatives because my dad was working and my mother traveled during the summer when she was not teaching school. I had a lot of responsibilities as a young child when I had to travel on my own to stay with relatives for the summer. This experience made me different from others. I could not fit in with others accounts of their summers and spending it with their parents and siblings. I felt really weird about this as a child. As an adult, I've come to realize this experience helped me learn how to be independent. Today, my independence is extremely important to me both at home and at work. Societal norms don't always appreciate or consider traits and habits we learn. Culture in my experience is often in conflict with outside influence and expectations. My own experiences of being independent at such a young age (9 years old), supports my current learning style preferences, (self-motivated distance education courses). Maybe I am way off on this topic but the discussion so far has certainly made me think and wonder why I approach learning a certain way and what really drives me and my learning preferences? Are these questions asked by instructional designers everywhere?

U5 ,"Hi U4, 
I think that every Instructional Designer comes to a point where they have to question how their personal culture influences the way they prefer to learn and even the way they choose to design courses. Designers also learn to ask the same question about their target audience. What drives my learners and how would they best absorb this information based on their learning preference? 
It is great that the discussion has made you stop to think about why you feel the way you do about certain learning climates. I constantly have to keep myself in check when designing user experiences. I want to create it the way that I would enjoy learning it. Awareness of my norms and societal norms is a good starting place. It is hard to not be biased in what you think the learner needs!

U17 ,"U17’s Definition: Culture is the mindset, beliefs, and values held by a group of people.  Language is an important part of culture as it is how the group communicates.  Culture can be geographic made up of people with shared history.  It may also be cultivated within a community, such as an organization working together for a shared goal or a group of people from different locations coming together over shared interests (think Comic-Con).
U13-I wholeheartedly agree that culture is learned and not inherited.  As you said, culture is passed from one generation to another.  If children are taught tolerance and acceptance of differences, they will then teach their children to be tolerant and accepting.


U17’s Definition: e-Learning is technology assisted learning.  It is often referred to as online or distance learning.  e-Learning has expanded rapidly in recent years as it is convenient for non-traditional students or those who are far away from the institution from which they wish to learn.  This type of learning generally requires the student to be more self-motivated.
U14 and U16-You both reference the rise of e-learning during the 80s/90s with the availability of computers and the internet. As U14 mentioned, these things are now so commonplace that they are part of ""normal life.""  Googling has become a verb to look something up on the internet.  We essentially have access to everything we could ever want to know at the touch of our fingertips.  I like U16’s utility of e-learning that it allows, ""delivery of education"" (technology) ""to a large number of recipients at the same or different times"" (convenience and availability).



U13’s Question: ""Would developing eLearning and teaching models which match to the user's perception promote acceptance to eLearning in different cultures?""



U17's Answer:  In short, yes, but its complicated.  I think that matching teaching models/styles and technology (e-learning) to cultures would promote acceptance of these as effective learning tools.  However, think of the time, effort, and money that would go into personalizing education.  The reality of it is so much more complex than the idea.



This question reminded me of personalized medicine.  The idea that doctors can tailor drugs and treatments to an individual based on their genomic code is both exciting and scary.  Could we do the same with education?  I have concerns that the more we see ourselves as different, the less accepting we will become of others differences.  I agree with U14’s comment that catering to “one’s perception or vision of the world” may “reinforce their biases” and lead to a “more fragmented and divided society,” rather than the learning community one would hope it would become.

Thank you for sharing the link on Personalized Medicine. I appreciate your perspective on how we may drift away from accepting each others different cultural backgrounds if we personalized education to each learner.

If future instructors/trainers reflect on cultural aspects of their audiences, and adapt their content accordingly, we can make enormous gains in promoting knowledge while sustaining cultural treasures. 
 
This philosophical approach to culture, I believe should not be limited to eLearning, but hopefully incorporated into wider teaching, employment, humanitarian and global practices.

U19 ,"I agree with U13 that culture is learned, but I also do believe that it can be inherited as well. Maybe not genetically passed down through generation but I do agree that it is learned and also inherited. Culture to me is dependent on the individuals willingness to acquire as quoted by Edmundson (2007) ""knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits as a member of society"". Of course I do believe that members of society may different in other countries to each race, ethnicity, etc. It's dependent on the individuals beliefs. 
Elearning is the ability for all types of society members to come together and learn. It's the ability to test boundaries and grow out of our comfort zones. Here again Edmundson (2007) quotes principles of Elearning students as looking at it as an adventure, and adapting to a new environment, along with open mindedness to try new things, as well as joining study groups and social groups. Looking at Elearning as a virtual community of culture can help individuals looking to participate in such an environment. 
To answer U13's question, I do believe that models unique to different cultural perspective would encourage a greater acceptance amongst different cultures to eLearning, however, I believe that the challenge that comes with the different perspectives in an eLearning course would be taken away if teaching models were created for unique cultures. It's the mix of various cultures being able to come together in an eLearning environment that makes eLearning much more acquiring of new information for those looking to seek it.

U20 ,"U13's definition of culture and eLearning _ U20
I wasn't sure where to respond and then realized the very first post said to respond to U13's initial post. So here it is...
U14 said culture is how we identify ourselves. U13 said it gives us a sense of direction. U18 explained culture as exposure that shapes the way we think. All of those are correct. I took a course on Wisdom in Spring this year and we had to define wisdom. Those qualities mentioned above defining culture are paramount to defining wisdom as well. The difference though is that some cultures can be toxic or unhealthy. For example; the drug culture. Whereas wisdom is looked at as beneficial for the greater good in some way. So I would like to add that culture can have a positive or negative impact on society.  
Tamera said something interesting, “that culture can be inherited, not genetically passed down but inherited.” I think that there is more that is genetically passed down than we give credit. If a family has a predisposition to anxiety, bipolar, albinism, cleft palate, intellectual disability to name a few; all those genetic factors can play a huge role in your culture. I think we can all agree that our life experiences do lead to a set of cultural beliefs. I would be interested to read more on adoptions studies and genetic influence on culture. I would argue that you can pass culture down genetically in some way. Unlike my argument that Culture is a genetic trait somehow.  Cultural DNA posits that the culmination of one’s life is their culture, but just as unique each individual is, so is their culture (Gunawardena, Frechette & Layne, 2019).
I think that ELearning is modern learning. Most industrialized cultures are highly dependent on electronic use. I see the world through American lenses and do not know enough of what is going outside of our borders but education in this country is heading toward an E based learning system. Recently I went to research at a local library and was told that I should look online.
My answer to U13’s question is simply, yes. If you market to a consumer, such as U14 mentioned, they will be more interested. It is an interesting thought of how to market to all cultures individually  in one course if we all do in fact have unique “cultural DNA.”

U20 ,"U19- I have worked a lot with disabled populations and their disabilities play a big role in how they interact with the world. The individuals would get together with other individuals with disabilities in the workforce, for Special Olympics, they would have their own subculture. It was more accepting of people with disabilities. They’d laugh and have their caretakers and not care who was watching when they danced the “funky chicken.” It is a fun environment innocent. I’m not sure about the mental health aspect not comorbid with the disabilities I’d have to think more about how that could affect culture. I guess it would fall into the family culture like U7’s example of the twins who had not met their father and one who was like the father he never met. Let’s say for example he had a mental health issue that genetically was from his father. Let’s say anxiety and he was raised in a boisterous family but was an introvert and didn’t relate to that culture.

U6 ,"This is a great conversation thread! I started writing and then stepped away for a few hours to have dinner with the family and came back to so many more ideas and posts.
I feel that culture is a mixture of what you have witnessed, the people you have known or encountered, the places you have traveled along with your beliefs, familial situations, and experiences. I feel like my culture is in a constant state of flux, always changing, growing and shaping me into the person I am today and will be tomorrow and while I agree with Gary Fine when he says that culture is shared by “members of an interacting group” I still believe there are very individualistic attributes as well.  Growing up with several sets of parents over the course of my childhood and teenage years and at one point having no parents have impacted my idea of culture significantly and made me into the kind of person who can adapt quickly to new cultures and loves experiencing life through the eyes of others.
While I used to think of eLearning as being a strictly online course with discussion posts to communicate, I have recently discovered it takes more than an internet connection and a computer to be a part of an eLearning community. Like Marion stated, “there needs to be an attempt to engage the learner through activities, discussions, interactions, etc.” and those interactions and activities often have a way of reflecting each person’s culture. I feel that each person’s culture is reflected in the way we learn, especially in the online environment. There are many instances in online course discussions where I have witnessed a clique form in the discussion boards or other times the posts were very similar to Facebook posts which I feel is in agreement with U21 in her statement that “Americans are more individualistic.” It is interesting how our lifestyles, beliefs and social norms are reflected in the learning environment.  
As for the question posted by U13, ""would developing eLearning and teaching models which match to the user's perception promote acceptance to eLearning in different cultures?"" I think the answer is yes. I teach people who work in vehicle maintenance or a parts room capacity and have learned that people are more receptive to me because I have actually worked in a shop or parts room, I know the lingo and can give relatable examples because I understand that culture. I feel the same would be true in other situations and especially in the eLearning environment, it would be useful because people will have a better time relating to the modules and course.

U3 ,"Hi U13,
Interesting question in the end. I really appreciated that quote that you put by Kopholklang, that ""culture flashes on the goodness that acknowledges, practices, and passes from one to later generations"". For your last question, my take is that developing eLearning and teaching models that match to the users' perceptions is certainly better than teachings that do not match the users' perceptions. To add onto that, it is important for the users to recognize the instructional designers' intentions on understanding and promoting the users' cultures. I believe that in order for a teaching to be effective, it needs to be a collaboration between the instructional designers and the learners, especially in a highly interactive learning environment such as eLearning. What I meant was that, when the learners are given the flexibilities to express their cultural differences in interactive learnings, and when the learners are actually encouraged to bring in cultural diversity into a collaborative learning environments, the learners will feel appreciated and respected, which in turn could results in learners helping the teachers and other learners to build a supportive and inclusive learning communities.

My simple definition of culture is our cultivation of what we learn from everyone around us but you all blew my mind with your definitions—from U16’s beliefs, ideas, and traditions, U13’s idea of inheriting culture, U5’s hair analogy (love it), U15’s 3 areas of our meaning of culture and U20’s positive and negative impact on culture.  You all made me think more. I take in so much from everyone here and I am constantly learning. Thank you.
I think elearning began in the late 80s when the internet (WorldWideWeb) became available to the online world. I remember when the internet became available in Zimmerman library and you could look up anything with results in seconds; there were chat rooms for anything and everything and people learned from other people a new skill, learned about another culture, learned another language, etc. I, now, have friends in Turkey; I learned a little bit of Turkish; I even visited the country all because of the internet and now someone there may know a Navajo word or two. Since then we have progressed to web conferencing, videos, facetime, taking online classes.  Like U12, this is my first time taking an online class and it has been an eye opener, maybe it’s my age, but I’m finding myself trying to figure out stuff that I feel I should already know being that I work in the library and we always keep up with technology. It took me forever to figure out the headset to work with my computer in hopes that my web conferencing would work when we first met online.  Sheesh! 
Which leads me to U13’s question, would developing eLearning and teaching models which match to the user's perception promote acceptance to eLearning in different cultures.  Yes, I think it can but I’m on the same wave length as U17 regarding costs and the complexities. It depends on the situation.  It worked for the kids who did online learning in the Australian video. There weren’t many children and I wondered about the costs involved to get the school going and for it to be successful.  I went home this past weekend and I wasn’t able to receive internet or phone service on the reservation.  As I watched the video, I thought about the possibility of a replication of an online component on the reservation but that poses so much difficulty in funding, getting phone service to some houses or communities and then knowing the Navajo culture and integrating that within the teaching model, so complex.
I spoke with someone the other day about generations and technology.  The person said my generation (I’m 55) uses Facebook for reconnecting with old friends from college and family; we knew what it was like to not have a computer or iPhone; we would prefer to call and use email and even mail a letter. His generation (age 25) uses texting and other social media like tweeter, Instagram, some Facebook and Tumblr (fandoms) and they’re savvy with technology and not afraid to use it.  The current generation relies on technology, handheld devices, use snapchat in place of texting and Facebook and they may be more cognizant of their safety on the internet and protect themselves using snapchat so it doesn’t get saved and used against them. They have fake Facebook accounts, one for their small circle of friends and one for family, friends not in their circle (parent’s friends, teachers, sibling’s friends) and public. That in itself is a lot to think about when teaching, the teaching models used and considering the integration of culture in elearning. ",1,0,1,0,3,11,5,5,1,7,67,52,0.712328767

I feel like you and I were having similar conversations about interfacing with technology, and generation differences!
My parents were visiting from out of state this past week and my dad (80) wants a new tablet, however he only wants the one he has had before (out of date) because he knows how to navigate it and get frustrated easily when he can't figure out something.  My son let him borrow his iPad and would simply help him/fix whatever was wrong, and my dad would be stunned that a 13 year old could figure it out so easily.  As you said, digital natives totally jump right in!

U6 ,"Hello U22,
I like your question about how to overcome the generational differences and have a lot of experience in this. I train various computer systems to people who have worked most of their lives with their hands or operating equipment. Technology is not only frustrating to them, but they are so afraid to mess something up that it takes tons of patience and encouragement to get them to try to use it. I have learned to find things they are interested in and start by showing them how to use Google or something relevant to their lives to help them gain confidence. I can usually build lessons based on their interests, needs, and skills to help them learn to take chances and try new things. I am amazed at how much progress we can make when I stop focusing on the end result and just help them to explore areas of interest until they are more comfortable and ready to tackle the programs they need to learn for their job.",0,2,0,0,0,5,4,1,0,0,34,54,0.739726027
U22 ,"Thanks U15 and U6 for sharing experiences.  I like your idea U6 of starting with something familiar or relevant that the user is knowledgeable about or is interested in searching.  I work with people (homeless, older people and some people who don't own a computer or phone) in the library who come up to the desk asking how to look up something because they don't know how to use the computer. They also don't know we have computers to use for an hour a day so we register them and we'll try to show them how to use the mouse, how to navigate the internet, how to set up email etc. Often they do think they're going to break something, sometimes this takes consultation until they feel a bit comfortable with the computer. They eventually figure it out and they come back often with this new found knowledge and connecting to the world.  :)
U15...my mom is in the same boat trying to learn technology. My mother is 77. I was actually surprised at how fast she learned how to post on Facebook from her phone after I explained what to do via phone call. I tried to explain wireless, data usage, updates but that went over her head.  :)  She doesn't have a computer and she would like to learn but she says it would only frustrate her because no one would be around to help. She said the younger generation get frustrated and don't want to help because they're always in a hurry. They press a button, type, and press something else and they tell you the information and go without explaining. She's getting used to her phone now and her next step is iPad maybe. :) ",2,0,0,0,0,14,5,2,0,0,49,55,0.753424658
U5 ,"U13, 
I love that you clarified that culture is not inherited, rather it is learned throughout your life! There is a distinct difference in the generational cultures and their approach to eLearning. I think that we as eLearning Designers can do a better job of catering to that difference. eLearning focuses on closing the geographical distance but does little to cover the generational differences. Much of the difference between generational cultures is a polarization of values from the previous generation. When done thoughtfully, I think eLearning can bridge that gap and encourage collaborative learning for all ages of students.

U11,"I think culture is the roadmap by which we see, understand and navigate the world. It is concurrently specific to an individual and a linkage to others who share the same background, beliefs and learned behaviors (both overt and covert). Culture is almost entirely nurture based, as we learn through both explicit instruction and implicit behaviors of those around us. But I do wonder if there are parts of our personal cultures that are hardwired. For example, I decided to become a vegetarian at the age of 7. I am the only vegetarian in my family and no one I was exposed to at an early age was vegetarian. Once I made the link from what was on my plate to a living being I was not interested. Now, I definitely seek experiences and interactions that reflect the related values and behaviors…even though I’m uncertain where the outlook & behaviors came from in the first place. I’m torn even mentioning this as a cultural factor, but it does affect how I see, understand and navigate the world—and since that is my definition I’m including it.
 E-Learning is any learning that is done using electronic media rather than a face-to-face setting. At this point, I think I would even include non-internet based correspondence classes as they are likely to submit items via email or upload.
U13's Question: Would developing E-Learning and teaching models which match to the user's perception promote acceptance to E-Learning in different cultures?
 Yes and no. It would depend heavily on the type of class, the subject matter and the goal of the learning experience. In a local college class this, to my understanding, would work very differently than if we were creating training modules for a multinational organization.
 Regardless of I think that initially, matching the e-learning to the understood culture could ease the way into e-learning. It might be appropriate in introductory courses or modules—allowing students new to e-learning to engage more fully in the process. But ultimately we could lose out on learning if we don’t provide learners with the opportunity to negotiate cultural differences.",1,0,0,4,0,12,6,7,3,1,52,57,0.780821918
U9 ,"Erica,
Interesting point about the hardwired aspect of culture.  Your story about becoming a vegetarian at an early age makes us question; why, at such an early age, without others around to model the benefits, would a child choose to do this?  Your story has striking similarities to a family member, who also announced they would become the only vegetarian in the family at an early age and remain one into adulthood. 
I agree with your point that culture is nurture based, and I would think you may have been nurtured to evaluate, question and believe in yourself, which enabled you to make this lifestyle choice.
Thank you for sharing your story.  It helped me engage with the topic.

I'll have to take some time and properly consider if the characteristics you listed are indeed part of m familial culture.

U8 ,"I could relate to David Matsumoto’s definition of culture. “The set of attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviors shared by a group of people, but different for each individual, communicated from one generation to the next.”  In my experiences with family and friends within the Hispanic culture, my educational responsibilities are not recognized as high priority compared to family and friend events and responsibilities. There is not much understanding about what it takes to study and little empathy for the deadlines that are required of me to complete my education. I understand that there are family responsibilities that must come first, but I have little help juggling many hats. Because of a death in the family, my family responsibilities have since increased. I often feel like I am replacing family with school work, and I get a guilty feeling even though I realize the benefits to being educated.
I was curious to see if my reality of culture and education were similar. I found several resources that explain the culture of Hispanics within an education system.
An Eric Digest publication identifies cultural values that may impact the learning processes of Hispanic-American students. Family commitment is paramount, and the article described how a female Hispanic is perceived as nurturing and self-sacrificing. That certainly fit my reality of culture.
Moving to the textbook, I was able to identify my preferences regarding online learning. The following struck me as important:
•	Co-mentoring
•	Learner support
•	UDL
•	Feedback based assessment
•	Social Presence as a strong prediction of learner satisfaction

U10 ,"Personally, I find it difficult to grasp the simple concept of culture because of its complexity. What adds to this complexity is that there are various sizes of culture. For example, the population of people who are significantly taller than an average person is less than those who are graduate students. As you mentioned, it is vital to be mindful of one’s cultural programing to in turn identify cultural differences. This is especially important when designing instruction for a specific culture (e.g., West Africans).",0,0,2,0,0,8,3,3,1,0,20,61,0.835616438
U18 ,"My initial definition for both culture and E-Learning is the following:
Culture is made up of the different experiences, interactions, and exposure one has encountered in  life. It can be influenced by a variety of things such as   family, friends, religion, education, environment, occupation, socioeconomic background, race, gender,  etc.  From these influences, it can dictate a persons' values, rituals, and traditions they have been accustomed to. 
After reading Chapter 2 from our class textbook, I learned culture has a  connection with cognition as well.  ""Culture shapes the cognitive processes of systems that transcend the boundaries of individuals.""(Gunawardena, Frechette, & Layne, 2019, pg.22) Because every participant in a collaborative setting plays a key role in the learning process, it is just as important to understand the cultural environments each person comes from. These cultural factors play a key role on how learners interact with one another when problem solving or gaining knowledge as a learning community. In retrospect, culture provides valuable resources and guidance when accomplishing goals as a group. 
E-Learning is a type of learning done virtually rather than face to face instruction. This type of learning requires a digital device and Internet connection in order to have access to the course. E-Learning can be convenient to the learner because it allows them to manage the course around their schedule. Furthermore, it allows students and instructors to participate in a course from different parts of the world. Therefore, classes can be made up of a diverse group in which culture plays a key role in student/instructor collaboration.
U13's Question: Would developing E-Learning and teaching models which match to the user's perception promote acceptance to E-Learning in different cultures?
Great question! I was thinking towards a question like this, basically how could E-Learning accommodate each learner and their cultural background. So to answer your question, yes I think developing it to where it would match each user's perception would promote acceptance of E-Learning in various cultures.
As we have learned from the assigned reading, Globalized E-Learning Cultural Challenges, the design of the course is just as important as the actual content.""The purpose is to build mutual accommodation and respect for the culture of others in order to reach academic success."" (Edmundson, 2007, pg.10) This not only depends on the language being used within the course, but also how the course is designed for the learner. An example is how red text to the Chinese culture is interpreted as a ""warning"", in which changes how they interpret the context just because of the color it was presented in. Another great example was that Arabic language is read from right to left instead how native English speakers read left to right. These are just two examples on how building a culturally-sensitive OLE (Online Learning Environment) is significant to the learning experience. 
If E-Learning was capable of matching each user's perception, this would help breakdown those barriers that are encountered in an OLE. I am curious to see if anyone has any ideas on how this could be possible or if it has happened with E-Learning? ",1,1,0,0,2,12,7,7,1,5,51,62,0.849315068
U23 ,"This is quite an interesting discussion on what culture means to each of us and the ways in which it influences our actions, beliefs, ideals, etc.. For the most part, I agree with U13's definition of culture in that we are all products of our environment and that we are sculpted individually by the circumstances and experiences of our lives. Indeed, most of us are predefined (both internally and externally) by the cultures in which we were brought up. As an American, I am well-aware of the ways in which values/beliefs such as self-sufficiency, individualism, and 'manifest destiny' have influenced my development and worldview. While I strive to be aware of my cultural biases and control for them, upon introspection I often find that they are still highly prevalent in the way in which I interact with the world around me. 
Additionally, the definition (and reflections) on culture from many of you mirrors my own in that it suggests the development (and prevalence of) wisdom within our respective communities. While we all have unique upbringings, belief structures, and identities, a common thread that I have noticed is that these values and beliefs about culture can often be similarly applied to those who we deem to be ""wise"" within our communities. We discuss aspects of knowledge, community-mindedness, and norm-expression, which are all discussed in our readings this week regarding wisdom, 'wise communities,' and the WISCOM framework. To me, culture and wisdom go hand-in-hand. Culture, in a general framework, sets the standard for who we are, strive to be, and what is expected of us within various social groups and roles. As such, someone who encompasses these beliefs, ideals, etc., is seen as 'wise' due to their abilities to navigate and communicate within these roles/norms. I am curious, therefore, about the universiality of wisdom across communities; as we saw in Gunawardena, Frechette, & Layne (2019), wisdom is a concept that is recognized across cultures and communities throughout the world (with varying definitions and expectations) and while there is a common thread across these definitions, I cannot help but assume that someone who is deemed 'wise' in one culture may not be similarly seen in another. In this way, wisdom, like culture, is contextually-dependent.
In terms of e-Learning, I would agree that it is a form of education that occurs within the digital/online environment (as many of you have stated). Simply put, it is distance education supported by a digital communication medium. For me, I do not see the distinction between ""learning"" and ""e-Learning"" as relevant anymore considering the speeds at which we can interact online these days; the idea of e-Learning (to me) suggests asynchronous and piecemeal learning within an online framework which, while relevant a decade ago, is not representative of the capabilities of today. 
To elaborate, connectivity today allows us to communicate in real-time across the world. This goes far beyond simply chatting or a Skype call in that we can now work collaboratively on large, data-intensive processes regardless of geographic distance. A scientist in China can control a robot on the US East Coast with little-to-no lag time between command and execution; when it comes to education, this means that we can learn together as a class with minimal technical problems and complete even the most robust assignments in real-time (controlling for any logistical issues of course). 
There is the issue (opportunity) of culture within the e-Learning environment that we must discuss. While we have discussed (and attempted to minimize) the opportunities of e-Learning within the contemporary online environment, this has simply allowed us to better examine/appreciate the differences in personal culture/learning preferences of learners. Without the limitations of 'classic' e-Learning, we are now able to experience online learning on the same terms as learning in the classroom wherein we can engage with individuals as more than a name on the screen in some theoretical place we have never seen or (perhaps) ever heard of. 
On a final note, I agree with U14 that e-Learning strikes me as a ""buzzword"" from a time past when organizations learned the potential of decentralized and digitally-driven education in the workplace. As suggested above, the term ""e-Learning"" feels foreign and clunky as I don't feel that it adequately captures the essence of online/distance learning as an equal to traditional classroom learning. Perhaps this is from my upbringing which looked upon online education with derision as an inferior form of education to in-person learning.",0,1,0,1,2,19,5,6,2,2,60,63,0.863013699
U12 ,"For this exercise, I wanted to see what my ideas about culture and eLearning were without having read any of the assigned readings in order to see how my conceptions of them changed within the new context of this class. It has been interesting to watch how my definitions become more complex as my understanding of the studies around these two topics changes.
Culture: Original definition
A combination of practices, traditions and behavioral norms adhered to by a group of people that consciously or unconsciously tie them to / identify them as a part of a defined group.
Culture: Updated Understanding
What struck me most was Vigotsky's conceptualization of ""development as the transformation of socially shared activities into internalized processes."" In this way, culture is taught in an interphyscological way (between people), and also intraphsychologically (within ourselves as individuals). Although this was part of the cultural-historical perspective on learning section (Gunawardena 2019, page 18), it's interesting to consider how much of culture is tacit (unspoken, but agreed upon by engaging within that culture) and how much of it is explicit (something you knowingly and willfully engage in).The WisCom framework attempts to incorporate this understanding by including an emphasis on the influence of culture and context within learning (Gunawardena 2019, page 21), and what what I was attempting to capture by noting that we are consciously or unconsciously tied to it. It seems the more we are aware of our own cultural underpinnings, the more conscious and inclusive we can be of others'.
I especially appreciated the Zulu maxim ""a person is a person through other persons"" (Gunawardena 2019, page 45).  U7, I wonder if this is something similar to what you meant when you said that although your values stay the same, the culture that you interact with is different at work than it is in church. I wonder if this transformation, or perhaps ""code-switching"" (a term that was once meant to describe switching from one language to another based on the setting in linguistics, but has become commonly understood to mean switching your language, dialect, accent, references or cultural norms to fit a specific cultural setting) is something that we all engage in, however subtly, as our culture and values are an inherent part of our personhood, but that the expression of that culture varies based on our environment.
This only becomes more complex as we discuss Goodfellow & Hewling's writing on high and low context settings, which can be used to contextualize interactions and interpret someone's meaning (Goodfellow & Hewling 2005, page 357). U15, I wonder if this is also part of what you were referencing when you mentioned intersectional nature of culture.
eLearning: Original Definition
Similar to U4, I originally considered eLearning to simply be a curriculum or program of study delivered through methods that are supplied solely online or via the Internet.  
eLearning: Updated Understanding
This becomes ever more complex when you consider that culture, context and social interaction shape learning, including via language, signs and systems (Gunawardena 2019, page 17). What struck me the most is how varied eLearning can be, and how Distance Education and eLearning are not interchangeable. It seems to me that eLearning, in its most basic form, is defined in my original definition, but that it has many components. It seemed that some people thought that eLearning and Distance Ed were the same thing, but I read the case studies between by Goodfellow & Hewling to show just how different they are, where Distance Education followed a more prescribed form of learning, with provided printed materials, set meeting times etc., but the eLearning emphasizes the leveraging of the Internet to ensure that the learning has a very flexible and accommodating learning environment, tailored to their learning preferences. U14, I specifically appreciated your thought on this.
I know that we are working on a consensus of what these two definitions should be, and I hope I haven't simply added to the noise here! Thank you all for sharing your thoughts! ",0,0,1,0,2,20,6,12,2,7,60,64,0.876712329

It was just one I stumbled upon that I wanted to share.

U9 ,"Culture
Great to see such energetic harmony from this group’s members with respect to culture.  Thank you all for your thoughts.  Our readings have expanded my perception of culture from ethnic, geographic, socioeconomic, educational background, art, language.  As I learn more about the factors that influence culture, I am feeling humbled knowing it is dynamic, ever-changing and redefining me as I react to and engage with the world around me.
Clair raised a strong thought-provoking concept of cultural factors that can be genetically passed on such as “a predisposition to anxiety, bipolar, albinism, cleft palate, intellectual disability…all those genetic factors can play a huge role in your culture.”  Having a loving or professional connection with someone afflicted with a predisposition, is just one example of how certain cultural factors can expand and redefine our perceptions of this ever-evolving concept of human culture.  
eLearning
Having worked in Audiovisual/Instructional Media support services in the past and present, we routinely promote the concept of utilizing emerging formats into our service support philosophies.  As U14 expressed, I to share the idea that eLearning is the current term or concept for distance education.  eLearning is unique as it enables numerous communities to collaborate in real-time while utilizing a variety of formats to maximize audience comprehension and promote dynamic teaching styles.  In present day, eLearning utilizes the internet to connect networks of people around the world.  It is a progressive means of knowledge sharing which can influence efficient teaching learning and even promote social change and solve pressing problems.
How culture and eLearning are related
The internet and its ability to connect people around the world and share knowledge marks a unique period in human existence.  The opening of our text powerfully sets the stage with respect to how culture and eLearning are related.  Time and space no longer limit how we interact with one another.  Technologies, particularly the Internet, have connected humanity across countries and cultures with profound implications on how we think, communicate and learn (Gunawardena, Frechette, Layne 2019).  As U5 suggested, I agree, we do develop our own unique cultures within online communities as we notice in the OILS course.  We actively develop more awareness of our classmates’ communication styles while we exercise sensitivity to expand our knowledge of understanding of the group dynamic and the instructional content.
U13’s Question: 
Would developing eLearning and teaching models which match to the user's perception promote acceptance to eLearning in different cultures?""
I believe eLearning can gain acceptance in different cultures if Instructional Designer and or Instructor/Content Expert exercise cultural sensitivity in design and reflection of the quality of audience/instructor interaction.  Sustaining objectivity is critical as stagnation can limit conceptual designs for unique culturally diverse audiences and functions.  Instruction that promotes learning across cultures seeks to accommodate diverse perspectives and preferences by following the principles of universal design for learning (UDL) rather than anticipate individual learner differences upfront.  These principles emphasize flexibility and learner choice. (Barajas & Higbee, 2003).  As we design with rearguard to our audience’s perception, review, evaluate, revise and remain engages as learners of design concepts while exercising cultural sensitivity, eLearning can and will gain acceptance.

U20 ,"U5,
I agree that communication, especially in a text, is a two-way street. One side has to effectively communicate avoiding the potential to be misunderstood. The other side needs to be open-minded and ask for clarification if not understanding. I'll reread my posts and think I sound rude or blunt, so I have to try to explain the intention or rewrite it all together. I am a fan of using an emoji here and there. What do you think? Do you think emoji are appropriate for an online master's program?
As I was typing this I thought that instead of having to log into a collaborate session it would be pretty neat if there was a zoom type function embedded into all discussions like a webcam conversation in a chat room. Even better than that could be a talk to text translator. So when the ""zoomish"" conversation was happening the computer could type it for us. That would be amazing. 
If we had that capability then there would be less misunderstanding or rather more clarification.
